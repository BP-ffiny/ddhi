      "Sentence 15: In the novel, Molloy considers that his mother may well be dead -'I mean enough to bury' -and that he has taken her place.\n",
      "Sentence 16: The novelist, on the other hand, left Ireland and his mother to return to France and the writing of the novel.\n",
      "Sentence 17: While making allowances for 'perhaps' as the key word in Beckett, we can still say that movement, as regards narrator and novelist (narrator as pseudo-novelist, and novelist as pseudo-narrator) is antithetical.\n",
      "Sentence 18: If writing is the subject matter of this writing, it is presented more as a matter of commerce and exchange than High Art.\n",
      "Sentence 19: The day upon which Beckett became aware of his own unknowing marks a kind of intersection between historical and personal lines.\n",

      "Sentence 22: Two years earlier, he had promptly left France for Ireland (in April 1945, even before the war was over), repeating the visit in 1946.7 Thus, either the day of extreme Cartesian doubt may be taken as hypothetical, or a date for the commencement of work on Molloy must be pressed back in time.\n",
      "Sentence 23: Though it was not his immediate post-war return to Dublin the occasion -as Beckett himself presents it -links the family reunion and the opening of his career as a novelist writing in French.\n",

      "Sentence 27: The earlier novels were written on different assumptions: Murphy is articulate to a fault, in contrast to Murphy; Watt possesses a geometrical audacity which leaves Watt cutting a very poor figure.\n",
      "Sentence 28: But now, adopting monologue at the same time that its author adopts French, the new novel leaves behind the seedy solipism of omniscient narration.\n",
      "Sentence 29: This recourse to monologue is replete with rich paradox, not only in its power to banish solipsism.\n",
      "Sentence 30: If, to some degree, Beckett required Madame Peron's linguistic assistance -and Beckett's fluency in French had allowed him pass among natives even in time of war -we should note also that Molloy in English is presented as a translation not by the author, but 'by Patrick Bowles in col laboration with the author.'8\n",
      "Sentence 31: In the preface to The playboy of the western world, J.M. Synge had written that 'All art is a collaboration'; his successor was uniquely placed in post-war France to savour the bitter ambiguity of the term.9\n",
      "Sentence 32: This richly paradoxical, inclusive monologism is accompanied in Molloy with Beckett's growing concern with 'the pair' -Molloy and Moran, Malone and Macmann -which becomes central in the plays from Waiting for Godot onwards.\n",
      "Sentence 33: In the fiction also, the concept of 'the pair' is deeply problematic, intractable and yet irresolute in itself.\n",

      "Sentence 41: And yet I do forget them and I watch the couple as they watch each other, a great way off.10\n",
      "Sentence 42: The integral privacy of the Beckettian character and his aesthetic insulation from historical process, as rendered fabulous by the critics, may yet be illuminated in a way which interprets the central concern with 'the pair' as part of a post-war literary conflict of the greatest political and philosophical interest.\n",
      "Sentence 43: Ah the old questions, the old answers, there's nothing like them!\n",

      "Sentence 64: The catastrophes that inspire Endgame have exploded the individual whose substantiality and absoluteness was the element common to Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and the Sartrean version of existentialism.\n",
      "Sentence 65: Even to victims of the concentration camps existentialism had attributed freedom either inwardly to accept or reject their inflicted martyrdom.\n",
      "Sentence 66: Endgame destroys such illusions.\n",
      "Sentence 67: The individual as a historical category, as the result of the capitalist process of alienation and as a defiant protest against it, has become openly a transient thing.\n",

      "Sentence 77: Parody, in an emphatic way, entails the use of forms precisely in the epoch of their impossibility.\n",
      "Sentence 78: Beckett's rubbish-bins are the emblems of a culture restored after Ausch 99 witz.\n",
      "Sentence 79: The twin priorities of Adorno's lengthy analysis thus emerge as t specification of a historical moment to which the play is intimat related, and the elaboration of its formal characteristics.\n",

      "Sentence 87: For Adorno, this legacy posed peculiar problems but there can be no doubt that the Hegelian theme in Endgame is precisely that of consciousness-as-pair, the complex dramatic monologue of Hamm and Clov which is in turn counterpointed by the pathetically intrusive contributions of Nell and Nagg in their dust-bins.\n",
      "Sentence 88: For Marxists, of course, Hegel's recourse to parable as a means of approach to the actual social processes of human labour only serves It is fitting that so many of the Marxist critics involved in this discussion of Beckett and Adorno should be Jewish -not only Adorno himself, but also Bloch, Lukacs, Marcuse, and the as-yet unmentioned Walter Benjamin.\n",
