harnessing the power of war to organize space.</s><s>Urban form is articulated through the defensive structure of the fortress: \\'it was the fortress as permanent fortification that settled the city into permanence . . . the surrounding wall is linked to the organization of war as the organization of space\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Virilio and Lotringer, 2008: 20)</ref>.</s><s>In this recounting of urban origins, war organizes space through fortifications, and fortifications bring about the birth of cities.</s><s>While doubt has since been cast on the originary role of the urban enceinte, such an account is nonetheless significant for the line of inquiry it opens into fortification as the relation between warfare, the design of the built environment, and the organization of space. 1 This article takes up this line of inquiry into the production of space by fortification, examining the legacies of early modern fortress design for contemporary political technologies of territorial control.</s><s>My interest is in the process by which linear fortifications gave way to defense in depth and how transformations of \\'depth\\' have come to integrate more complex, non-linear notions of space and time.</s><s>Such transformations reveal fortifications to be more mobile and dynamic than the seemingly inert figure of the wall would suggest.</s><s>By examining these forms of mobility, I ask how the \\'defensive\\' and \\'preparatory\\' techniques of fortification are making and re-making our collective world through the medium of organized violence.</s></p><p><s>While the material vestiges of earlier fortresses have often been absorbed by growing cityscapes, new modes of fortification work at multiple geographic sites, extending beyond the urban enceinte into international space and transforming the techniques by which space is defended.</s><s>Fortification takes on forms that range from \\'geophysical\\' walls along territorial boundaries to \\'microphysical\\' controls of movements through the built environment <ref type=\"bibr\">(Virilio, 1994: 203-204</ref>). 2</s><s> Furthermore, the radar curtain-a reference to the curtain wall of the fortress-serves as a kind of fortification of airspace.</s><s>This fragmented organization of space involves complex relations to time, whereby the speed and rhythm of movement are modulated in relation to projections of future risk and insecurity <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">(Davis, 2006;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">Duffield, 2011;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b53\">Klauser, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the spatio-temporal complexities of fortification, the language of fortification has become one of installing impassable obstacles through the use of cumbersome, seemingly inert materials of stone, earth, concrete, and metal.</s><s>Within this image, fortification is an architecture of creating clear lines between inside and outside and immobilizing enemies.</s><s>This is fortification as the power of an older order-a state imaginary involved in theatrical and increasingly desperate attempts to display sovereign power, even with the rise of discipline and biopolitics <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">(Brown, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The rallying cry in support of these fortifications speaks in terms of declining sovereignty.</s><s>Critiques of these fortifications also focus on reactions to sovereign decline.</s><s>In order to trace the spatial transformations from defense in depth to contemporary warfare, I focus attention on the spatial technologies of military architects and military engineers that would redefine urban space, filter into ideas of territory, and constitute sovereignty from the ground up.</s><s>As I will elaborate in detail, the designs of early modern fortress construction relied not only on the resilience of walls but also on lines of sight, the ability to survey the battlefield, and the possibility of strategic maneuver.</s><s>Today, urban and border fortifications emphasize to an even greater degree visibility, detection, and tracking <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">(Andersson, 2014</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b14\">(Andersson, , 2016;;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">Chamayou, 2012)</ref>. 3</s><s> Rather than focus on the elusiveness of enclosure, I approach fortification as a technique of power working through a combination of modulated control by obstruction and heightened detection.</s><s>This is a process of fortification that entails channeling movement through walled flows rather than strictly delimiting inside and outside <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">(Bernes, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Even the most dramatic forms of physical obstruction entail a politics of mobility, or \\'kinopolitics,\\' focused on the management of circulations <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b62\">(Nail, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Through this approach, I expand the analysis of boundaries to include the logistics of fortification and the underlying notions of geometry that inform how space is produced, organized, and surveilled.</s><s>With a focus on the way this technique transforms built environments and martial practices, fortification is generative-it designs, builds, organizes, and reorganizes.</s><s>Such a \\'martial empiricism\\' breaks with an emphasis on the destructive capacity of war, finding in the process of design for war the creation of political dynamics, social orders, and material artifacts <ref type=\"bibr\">(Bousquet et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Contemporary fortifications exhibit tremendous spatiotemporal complexity, creating mobile spatial controls over bodies and populations, exercised at multiple geographic scales.</s><s>This article suggests fortification plays a vital, not merely theatrical, role in contemporary warfare.</s><s>Fortification does not avert hostility but directs armed conflict through design.</s><s>Through the very act of guarding against the potential of future war, fortification embodies a kind of \\'becoming war,\\' whereby its \\'defensive\\' posture summons into being a built environment perpetually anticipating intensified violence <ref type=\"bibr\">(Bousquet et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Where earlier work has focused on the destruction of the built environment in war <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">(Coward, 2009)</ref>, my return to theories of military architecture finds the spaces of daily life produced and transformed through designs for war.</s></p><p><s>The first section examines the conceits and contradictions of the image of fortification as monolithic and immobilizing.</s><s>Departing from Brown\\'s critique of walling as a theatrical display of waning sovereignty, it seeks to unsettle the primacy of the wall as the medium of fortified power, turning attention to the infrastructural and logistical dimensions of fortification.</s><s>Fortification is not only an embodiment of sovereignty but also the planning, diagramming, and organization that supports and enables the possibility of martial power.</s><s>This approach-resonant with the radical empiricism informing this special issue-focuses on the micropolitics of fortification through which spaces of war are (re)produced.</s><s>The second section expands the concept of fortification to refer to an entire domain of knowledge that connects design and built form to martial-political order.</s><s>It does this by returning to the discourse of fortification emerging in and through early modern warfare.</s><s>If sovereignty is not a matter of control over \\'impermeable\\' borders but a historically specific conception of space, jurisdiction, and material practices <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b67\">(Shah, 2012)</ref>, an examination of the methods of design and architectural forms of fortification becomes indispensable to any account of power.</s><s>I track the discourse of fortification from architecture into military engineering and finally into the heart of military strategy and tactics, organizing space into \\'defense in depth\\' and supporting this strategy through geometrically defined lines of sight that provide total visibility of the battlefield.</s><s>In doing so, I engage with Clausewitz\\'s writings on defensive war to suggest that such war is not purely reactive, but rather that defensive war connotes a mode of intensified violence.</s><s>The third section follows the genealogy of fortification to the practices of defending space that arise with global war, focusing on the invention of radar and its significance for geopolitics.</s><s>Whereas the body of literature on global war emphasizes unrestricted mobility and movement across flattened global space <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">(Chamayou, 2012;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">Galli, 2010;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">Gregory, 2011;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b47\">Hardt and Negri, 2004)</ref>, I seek to highlight the modulated mobility established by fortification.</s><s>The aim here is not to suggest that contemporary fortification represents a return to earlier forms of warfare (cf.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">Betz, 2019: 40)</ref>.</s><s>Instead, fortification serves as a kind of infrastructural power, enabling certain movements while inhibiting others and in the process carving a complex geography of armed conflict into the international landscape. 4</s><s>Increasingly, the geometries of fortification, which had been defined by ideas of linear defense and defense in depth in early modern war, now gravitate toward a notion of non-linear defense, in which new combinations of obstruction and detection fortify space at multiple scales.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Imagining fortification</head><p><s>The image of power commonly evoked by fortification is one of a fortress raising high walls to repel plunder or invasion.</s><s>In this sovereign imaginary of fortification, often premised on an image of the medieval castle, clear lines separate inside and outside.</s><s>It is the immobility of the wall that guarantees security.</s><s>Wendy <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">Brown (2010)</ref> offers the most comprehensive philosophical investigation of this image of fortification.</s><s>In seeking to understand its allure, Brown considers the proliferation of wall-building projects and the paradox posed by their construction at a moment when globalization is heralded as a defining force of political life.</s><s>Such wall-building seeks to give physical form to sovereignty, installing impermeable lines between states and embodying a claim to absolute authority.</s><s>Yet, these walls are traversed in innumerable ways: they are frequently climbed over, tunneled under, or circumvented.</s><s>The aspiration of sovereignty that they embody is equally elusive: \\'one irony of late modern walling is that a structure taken to mark and enforce an inside/outside distinction-a boundary between \"us\" and \"them\" and between friend and enemyappears as precisely the opposite\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown, 2010: 25)</ref>.</s><s>Walls not only fail to secure sovereign authority; their very presence erodes distinctions between public/private, military/police, and law/ exception.</s><s>Walling projects rely, sometimes implicitly, on assemblages of police, private, paramilitary, and military power, and the construction of walls, justified in terms of the preservation of \\'law and order,\\' often involves exceptional legal measures that suspend or revoke written law. 5</s><s> Brown provides a compelling critique of the temporal logic-the envisioned relation between past, present, and future-within this sovereign imaginary.</s><s>Walls exhibit \\'a markedly archaic quality\\' and a \\'seemingly physical, obdurate, premodern signature\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown, 2010: 80)</ref>.</s><s>As tangible objects of sovereignty, walls \\'seem to embody precisely the power of the \"no,\"\\' and fortifications mark an old order of power <ref type=\"bibr\">(Brown, 2010: 81)</ref>. 6</s><s>The sovereign imaginary invoked draws upon an image of the past in which physical manifestations sustain decisive and unequivocal rule.</s><s>This past is an age of what Gros (2010: 11) calls \\'mythic war, existing only in and through stories, always situated in the mists of time, offer[ing] itself like a dream.\\'</s><s>The past invoked here subsists in an inchoate haze, appearing when called upon and vanishing at moments of contradiction.</s><s>The amorphous notion of mythic war allows one to maintain a sense that the construction of walls is a \\'virtuous\\' endeavor.</s><s>To imagine walls purely as embodiments of sovereign power conceals the racialized violence they inflict, the lines of global inequality they reinforce, and the extensive security industries that maintain them.</s><s>Brown\\'s incisive critique reveals the contradictions within this mythic register.</s><s>The proliferation of walls at national borders bespeaks a nostalgia for a sovereign power that no longer exists, if, in fact, it ever did.</s><s>This sovereign imaginary sees walls as an act of reclamation, enacting the military virtue of mythic war in an effort to model the future on a fabulated past. 7</s><s> Building on critiques of this sovereign imaginary, I turn attention to the immanent logic of fortification, the precise material forms and modes of spatial governance that enable this technique of power.</s><s>This is fortification as it is planned, designed, constructed, maintained, restored, and replaced.</s><s>Architecture, engineering, and military strategy rely on discourses of fortification that operate in non-mythic registers and work closely with the organization of space.</s><s>Where a sovereign imaginary envisions the fantastical, immanent mechanisms plan for the logistical.</s><s>The violence of bordering is produced not only through totalizing assertions of sovereignty but also through the material logistics of fortifying interventions themselves.</s><s>Logistics, for Virilio <ref type=\"bibr\">(Virilio and Lotringer, 2008: 20)</ref> constitutes \\'the beginning of the economy of war,\\' and as such, the first logistical act is the construction of fortifications.</s><s>Originating in military relations to space, time, and material organization, logistics is the field of technical preparations and calculations by which one establishes a supply line <ref type=\"bibr\">(Cowen, 2014: 8-13)</ref>.</s><s>The immanent logic of fortification envisions the creative capacities necessary for war-the series of movements, openings, and closings through which supply lines are maintained.</s></p><p><s>Where a sovereign political imaginary envisions and enacts the structural, an immanent logic produces the infrastructural.</s><s>As infrastructure, fortification amplifies and modulates, it is \\'a thing that facilitates other projects, a thing that expands flows, standardizes distributions, and extends political rationalities\\' <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b37\">(Fennell, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This immanent logic of fortification is more spatially and strategically dynamic than its sovereign imaginary.</s><s>In sovereign spatial organization, transcendent state power secures a bordered self against an invading force held \\'outside.\\'</s><s>In addition to this aspiration of sovereign enclosure, fortification also connects, enables, and subtends the entire enterprise of war.</s><s>Fortification alters the built environment with a particular disposition towards the possibility of war: \\'the ambition of conducting a war begins with the planning of its theater, or the creation of artificial environmental conditions, which will form the infrastructure, the stage on which the scenario should be played out\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Virilio, 1990: 14)</ref>.</s><s>To fortify oneself is not to avert war but to transform one\\'s environment for the conduct of war.</s><s>This is a distinct temporal logic from the sovereign imaginary of fortification, which sought to activate a mythic past of virtuous war in the present.</s><s>By contrast, the immanent logic of fortification reconstructs the built environment with possible futures of war in mind.</s></p><p><s>In this shift from structure to infrastructure and from the fantastical to the logistical, fortification appears as more than the power of walls to divide cities or decisively bound the nation-state.</s><s>The tendency to focus on walls has contributed to the treatment of fortification as inert and immobilizing, reducing a complex assemblage of barriers, fences, sensors, surveillance technologies, infrastructure, and architectural knowledge to The Wall.</s><s>Critiques of symbolic aspirations and concrete spatial technologies are not mutually exclusive, and in pursuit of combining them, we would be best served by thinking of fortification through its etymology as the creation of a \\'strong place.\\'</s><s>Such a process involves both the intensification of territorial boundaries, including but not limited to walls, but also the selective control of circulation.</s><s>In the creation of a \\'strong place,\\' logistical and infrastructural conditions extend the space of the border both inward and outward.</s><s>The wall is only one site in a mode of fortification that emulates doctrines of defense in depth.</s><s>With the extension of Border Patrol jurisdiction over the 100-mile border zone, approximately two-thirds of the United States population becomes susceptible to \\'interior enforcement\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(ACLU, 2018)</ref>.</s><s>The \\'externalization of borders\\' describes a process by which nation-states exert influence over border procedures beyond their territory through, for instance, the adoption of biometric and other surveillance technologies, the treatment of ports and waterways as key national security sites, and the standardization of controls at international airports <ref type=\"bibr\">(Weber and Pickering, 2014: 17-19;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Graham, 2011: 136-138)</ref>.</s><s>Fortification has come to occupy, both conceptually and materially, the interstices of war and policing and global and local space.</s></p></div>\\n<div

fortifications, I turn to the discourse of fortification that emerges within early modern military architecture and engineering.</s><s>The aim here is neither to locate an \\'origin\\' of fortification-one will seemingly always find an older instance of wall construction-nor to suggest that early modern Europe is the first moment of sustained reflection on fortification.</s><s>Rather, the return to this moment is a matter of locating the consolidation of a discourse on military architecture and engineering, the effects of which extend to colonization, the violence of settlement, and continue to be felt in contemporary security and war. 8</s><s> Fortifications begin to take new form following Charles VIII\\'s invasion of Italy in 1494.</s><s>Conducted with unprecedented speed due to the use of artillery to level high-walled stone fortifications, the invasion left Italian war planners defeated and in disbelief.</s><s>In response, they set out to design defensive structures capable of withstanding bombardment.</s><s>The innovation in artillery and ballistics \\'destroyed a whole paradigm of military architecture and forced the creation of a new style of fortification\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(DeLanda, 1991: 12)</ref>.</s><s>The result was the trace italienne, a design that included low ramparts, reinforced with earth to withstand cannon fire; ditches combined with walls that could not easily be scaled; and the defining feature, the angle bastion, a triangular protrusion from the walls, enabling a greater field of view <ref type=\"bibr\">(Kingra, 1993:

linear defense or defense in depth, but non-linear defense.</s><s>Through radar, the electromagnetic spectrum becomes both a scientific frontier and the medium through which to fortify national territory.</s><s>Radar technology both extends over the entirety of the national territory and is miniaturized in the form of the proximity fuze.</s><s>As research laboratories have become permanent fixtures in national defense, the logistics of fortification today involve not only a steady supply line but the ongoing development of new defense technologies-just-in-time fortifications for the everywhere war.</s><s>Even the seemingly linear defense of the wall suggests curvatures and entanglements of space and time.</s><s>The wall at the United States-Mexico border involves the circulation of materiel from the US invasion of Vietnam to the repeatedly colonized space of the US southwest, juxtaposing seemingly distant spaces and temporalities.</s><s>If the design of Renaissance fortifications retained a lingering sense of artistry, and the design of early modern fortification found its highest expression in simple polygons, the fortifications of everywhere war have gravitated toward principles of non-Euclidean geometry.</s></p><p><s>Where the military urbanism of Vauban sought to control space through the construction of polygonal fortifications and lines of fire, the \\'new military urbanism\\' utilizes obstruction and detection detached from linear defense <ref type=\"bibr\">(Graham, 2011: 60)</ref>.</s><s>Gates, fences, and walls cutting through cities resemble the securitization of state borders rendered at a different scale.</s><s>The temporal logic of defense in depth, whereby the slowing of the attacker\\'s advance grants time to the defender, is replaced by a more expansive sense of \\'anticipatory action,\\' which includes preemption, precaution, and preparedness <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">(Anderson, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Anticipatory actions determine distributions of risk contained in possible futures and apply calculative logics to contain, ameliorate, or cancel said risk.</s><s>The aim is not to avert conflict, but to guarantee a position of relative strength in any number of potential imagined conflicts.</s><s>Thus, even as fortification takes a \\'defensive\\' posture, it is always on the way to becoming war, acting against or securing a dangerous future.</s><s>Fortification operates on an anticipatory logic, preparing for a future of escalating risk by marshalling resources of the past in a militarized present.</s><s>In this anticipatory logic of fortification, the preparation for war turns into the medium of violence.</s><s>Preparation and precaution generate their own \\'maps of anticipation,\\' cartographies of risk and security that propel spatial organization for impending conflict <ref type=\"bibr\">(Jeganathan, 2004: 68)</ref>.</s><s>We find in these anticipatory logics the \\'infernal tendency\\' by which defense lashes out in acts, always deemed counter-attacks, of vengeful aggression.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Fortification as a technique of power offers a way to think about the defense of space that goes beyond displays of sovereignty, focusing instead on immanent, material conditions-processes of calculation, elements of design, and mechanisms of spatial organization driven by ideas of geometric order.</s><s>Such a shift in focus reveals a neglected history in which military architecture and engineering of early modern fortifications, informed by ideas of linear defense and defense in depth gave way to the fortification of space that adapts to the space to be defended.</s><s>The enduring legacy of fortification appears in the complex defense of space that functions at multiple scales, utilizing an array of technologies of detection, periodically obstructing selected movements, and relying on extensive logistical networks.</s><s>Following this genealogy, \\'defensive\\' fortification is a practice of maximizing violence by other means.</s><s>It names a process of anticipatory action taking form in the built environment, acting against the possibility of future risk and threat through spatial controls in cities and intensified violence at state borders.</s><s>Fortification is not yet open war, but a \\'defensive\\' approach to design in the sense that Clausewitz uses defense, as a reaching out and striking vengefully.</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" type=\"table\" xml:id=\"tab_2\"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>This content downloaded from

Suburb</s></p><p><s>A Roman city was a bounded space, confined by borders both physical and conceptual, which separated the urban zone and the life that occurred within it from all that stood outside.</s><s>Such boundaries had particular relevance for the tombs of the dead, which Roman law barred from the urban center.</s><s>Given this strict separation, something curious happened in the late Republican and (especially) early Imperial periods, a phenomenon that remains clearly evident in the archaeological record: Roman cities began to develop suburbs, that is, urban neighborhoods outside the boundaries of the city proper, where tombs of the dead intermixed freely with urban structures of all types.</s><s>Life and Death in the Roman Suburb, the book manuscript I have been preparing as a Rome Prize Fellow, explores the archaeology of these neighborhoods at Rome and other Italian cities large and small.</s><s>I argue that suburbs were integral parts of their cities, but that the presence of tombs gave them a distinct urbanism that differentiated them from the city center.</s><s>My aim, therefore, is not only to contribute to major debates on the character and development of Roman cities, but also to provide new perspectives on Roman attitudes toward death, emphasizing the relationship between the dead and the living as a fundamental aspect of Roman life.</s><s>This project joins several recent studies that have attempted to understand urban space outside the formal boundaries of Roman cities.</s><s>Current work has tended to emphasize growing populations and urban overspill as the motivators of suburban development, but that approach risks overlooking equally important and potentially more revealing factors.</s><s>Working from recent excavation and survey evidence, I identify a collection of overlapping and interrelated forces that played roles in the emergence of suburban urbanism and that help to isolate its characteristic elements.</s><s>Among the most significant of these forces was the presence of suburban tombs.</s><s>Rather than passive markers of separation, my analysis reveals that funerary spaces, and especially monumental tombs, were key drivers of urban growth, functioning as active forces in the social and economic worlds of their neighborhoods.</s><s>Tombs made up what are often referred to in scholarship as cemeteries, necropoleis, or streets of tombs, but those terms obscure the extent to which such neighborhoods could incorporate other suburban features: from rubbish dumps to shrines and sanctuaries; from shops, inns, and restaurants to major entertainment buildings; from the shacks of the humble to the villas of society\\'s most powerful.</s><s>Such features did not simply neighbor tombs, flowing around once-excluded funerary spaces as the city breached its original boundaries, but responded to and interacted with them.</s><s>These interactions, moreover, reveal diachronic changes in suburban life.</s><s>As suburbs arose, monumental tombs became increasingly common, attracting further development in a mutually reinforcing cycle.</s><s>For cities that continued to grow and densify, funerary spaces adopted a different role and began to serve as space-holders for new development, which increasingly destroyed and supplanted them.</s><s>My project is, therefore, a book about urbanism, but it is also a story of the living and the dead, and how they came together at a particular moment in time to create a particular type of city.</s></p><p><s>This time at the AAR has

b.c.e.</s></p><p><s>Roman tradition attributes the creation of the plebeian tribunate to the First Secession, during which two or five men were elected as leaders of the plebs who had abandoned patrician-led Rome in 494 B.c.e. over serious political disagreements.</s><s>They empowered the tribunes to pass plebiscites, or resolutions, binding only on plebeians, and to defend them against abusive patrician magistrates.</s><s>By 287 B.c.e., after centuries of agitation and civil struggle, the tribunate was formally recognized in the lex Hortensia as Rome\\'s principal institution for creating laws that would apply to all Romans, including patricians.</s><s>For over a century, the tribunes, senate, and other magistrates worked well together (for the most part).</s><s>But, in 133 B.c.e., to address an obvious and ever-widening gap of economic inequity, tribune of the plebs Tiberius Gracchus forcefully passed legislation to create a commission empowered to confiscate public lands illegally occupied by elite Romans and Italians and redistribute it to Rome\\'s indigent citizens.</s><s>Gracchus\\' aims and methods engendered a violent response from the elites (including fellow tribunes and senators), resulting in his murder and the beginning of the so-called \"Roman Revolution,\" a century of bitter political feuds and bloody wars that ended with the collapse of the Republic, the establishment of the Principate of Augustus, and the reduction of the tribunate to a shadow of its former self.</s><s>While tribunes are perhaps best known for the tumultuous political activity which Gracchus and his successors made famous, the tribunate as an institution was, historically, an important factor in shaping the Republic\\'s history as well as its legal and political institutions and culture.</s><s>Indeed, it contributed much to the administration and smooth functioning of the city of Rome and its growing empire.</s><s>For these and other reasons, the tribunate has always attracted scholarly attention, most of which has focused on legislative programs, prosecutions, or prosopography.</s></p><p><s>The book project I am working on at the American Academy in Rome is a macro-history of the tribunate as an institution, from its inception down to the age of Augustus, based on micro-histories of tribunician activity preserved in documents that survive from antiquity.</s><s>These micro-histories, assembled in a massive and detailed \"Chronology of Tribunes,\" include the work of many lesser-known tribunes-even anonymous tribunes whose actions alone have been preserved in our sources (over 600 between 493 and 31 B.c.e.).</s><s>The \"Chronology of Tribunes,\" itself a significant advance in available resources essential for new work on the tribunes, makes it possible to distinguish major patterns in tribunician activity, patterns that counter the natural tendency to comprehend the tribunate only through the actions of the notable and notorious.</s><s>It thus lays the groundwork for a substantial reassessment of debated issues, such as the tribunate\\'s central role in Rome\\'s administrative functioning and popular participation in politics and legislation.</s><s>The book addresses a number of issues, including the overall development of the tribunate, the nature of tribunician activity and interaction with constituent elements of the SPQR, and concludes with an examination of Augustus\\' appropriation in 23 B.c.e. of tribunicia potestas-without holding the office of tribune-as a key component of the emperor\\'s bundle of powers.</s></p><p><s>My time at the American Academy in Rome has allowed me to move my book project toward completion.</s><s>Proximity to the excellent AAR library and its affiliates has afforded me many opportunities to expand or clarify my research and to answer new questions as they crop up (without the interminable delays that come with using inter-library loan systems).</s><s>It has also afforded numerous opportunities to meet other scholars and writers-informally or at conferences-who share my research interests; have provided valuable feedback, insight and advice; and have inspired me to extend my (future) research endeavors into new areas.</s><s>Just as important has been the opportunity to greatly increase my knowledge of Rome and its urban history, especially for periods outside of my main discipline, thanks to Humanities Director Lynne Lancaster\\'s weekly \"Walks and Talks\" and to my fellow Fellows who have generously shared their expertise with the AAR community.</s><s>For instance, the tradition of Roman law was a coherent intellectual discipline during the Theodosian Age.</s><s>But the most significant overhaul of the system-the Theodosian Codeoccurred under a vehemently and violently Nicene Christian emperor, and the new legal regime shows signs of integration with the dominant Nicene epistemic regime.</s><s>Likewise, historians during the Theodosian Age continued to write history, but they did so with new methods and new aims.</s><s>Theologians of the early fourth century invented a new set of tools and gifted them to the wider scholastic environment.</s><s>My work this year at the American Academy in Rome focused first on clarifying the contours of these tools, and subsequently followed the cascade of changes in the material presentation of scholarly knowledge visible in the manuscript evidence from this period held at the Vatican Library and in other archives throughout Europe.</s><s>D. F.

of my work investigated innovative Nicene Christian writers, who wrote new texts in novel formats.</s><s>The second half investigated the new meanings that late ancient scholars brought to and read from their texts as a result of these texts\\' new material forms and epistemic framework.</s></p><p><s>At the end of my time at the American Academy I shifted focus to a new project which intends to describe how it is that ancient people came to think that theology was something like law-that it could be distilled, legislated, codified, and promulgated; that the objects of an individual\\'s belief could be exposed as a matter of justiciable fact.</s><s>The development of Christian doctrine into the metaphor of \"law\" has only been cursorily described, it has not been explained.</s><s>My central argument is that the invention of Christian jurisprudence, and the correlating consideration of Christian doctrine as somehow akin to \"law,\" arose initially out of material innovations in the presentation of doctrine.</s><s>Function followed form.</s><s>The coalescence of technical literature into a circumscribed set of forms that I describe in my dissertation serves to explain the \"juridification\" of ancient Christianity, and sets the stage for transition from the great doctrinal disputes and conciliar pronouncements of the fourth and fifth centuries to the handbooks and compendia of \"canon law\" of the early Middle Ages.</s></p><p><s>Both of these projects are fundamentally histories of ancient book forms and the ideologies that undergird them.</s><s>They aim to serve as a bridge between histories of two different types: those of politics and religion in Late Antiquity, written always in the shadow of a Roman Empire with its own institutions in which Christians appear as interlopers, and works of late ancient social history, in which the ideological structures that undergird an ascendant Catholic bureaucracy seem always already part of the fabric of Christianity.</s></p><p><s>MArK letteney, Princeton univerSity With the newly urban populace came a higher demand for animals to sacrifice.</s><s>Alongside the increased establishment of formal social roles came new rituals and also an intensification of existing religious practices.</s><s>The Roman religious framework was in place by the end Archaic period, so animal sacrifice from this period of change gives insights into the ritual practices that laid the foundations for Roman religion.</s><s>Animal sacrifice was not only a way to interact with the gods but could express power through the control and redistribution of resources.</s><s>Large-scale animal sacrifices provided meat for the people and allowed their sponsors to play a prominent part in these rites.</s></p><p><s>The animals for sacrifice and for consumption in the home were produced as part of a complex economic web that shifted with urbanization.</s><s>The higher population density and centralization of domestic and public spaces would have greatly affected who controlled meat production and where animals were raised.</s><s>The zooarchaeological remains from the ninth to sixth century B.c.e. can show differential access to meat in the home and in sanctuaries and how it was produced and distributed to these spaces.</s><s>The food system reflected the economy and social roles of early Rome.</s></p><p><s>The sites included in this study involve both domestic spaces and sanctuaries, including my analysis of three sites from the heart of Rome (the Area Sacra di Sant\\'Omobono, the Palatine-Curiae Veteres sanctuary, and the Regia), and my analysis of nearby urban centers of Veii, and Gabii.</s><s>At Sant\\'Omobono, the Archaic sanctuary hosted animal sacrifice and interment of mostly farm animals, namely young sheep, goat, pig, cattle, as well as a significant number of puppies.</s><s>Nearby at the Curiae Veteres sanctuary, cattle skulls were affixed to the walls and a range of animals were sacrificed, including large birds as well as sheep, goat, cattle, pig, and dog.</s><s>The Regia changed from huts to a monumental structure that was repeatedly reorganized, reflecting a shift from a simpler domestic space to a larger, permanent building.</s><s>At Veii, the Iron Age settlement was reorganized into an Etruscan open-air sanctuary, showing diet and ritual practice as the city became more urban.</s><s>At Gabii, two adjacent hut compounds show distinct consumption practices and changes over time as Gabii grew alongside Rome.</s><s>Together, these sites reveal new evidence for early Roman urbanism through production, distribution, and consumption of meat during the city\\'s foundation.</s></p><p><s>victoriA

Ostrogothic period (ca.</s><s>493-554 c.e.) the entire life of the Roman elite-social, political, religious, and cultural-was enveloped by the reading, writing, and performance of verse.</s><s>Roman education was centered on poetry; epithalamia were composed and performed at weddings; buildings-sacred and secular, public and private-were adorned with epigrams; hymns were composed and sung in churches; missteps in the social order were castigated by invective epigrams; and the deaths of significant men and women were commemorated with verse epitaphs.</s><s>Moreover, nearly every elite Roman aristocrat wrote verse.</s><s>Despite the all-encompassing importance of poetry to the life (and apparently the afterlife) of the Roman elite during the Ostrogothic period, few have asked why this was the case.</s><s>My dissertation project, \"Carmina Qui Quondam: Poetry, Identity, and Ideology in Ostrogothic Italy,\" started from this question: why did the political elite associate themselves so intimately with poetry?</s></p><p><s>\"Carmina Qui Quondam\" argues that during the Ostrogothic period the Roman elite in Italy utilized poetry both to maintain class cohesion and to exert political power.</s><s>The period is named for the Ostrogoths, an ethnically distinct military elite that governed along with the Roman elite (including the Senate).</s><s>Ostrogothic and Roman elites co-ruled a wounded but resilient multi-ethnic Roman empire, with both groups appealing to their own \"natural\" superiority to justify the joint rule.</s><s>Erudite Latin poetry, as a sign of education, wealth, and Roman tradition, was thought to demonstrate the intellectual and moral superiority of the Roman elite.</s><s>As a result, Latin verse was an integral component of elite Roman identity.</s><s>Moreover, because poetry was a public form, Roman elites used it to project competing ideological agendas not only among factions of Roman aristocrats but also to Ostrogothic elites and the humbler citizenry.</s><s>My dissertation traces these competing identities as well as changing ideological positions from the beginning of the Ostrogothic period until the destruction of the Ostrogothic state in the ruinous 20-plus-year Byzantine-Gothic Wars.</s></p><p><s>My tenure at the American Academy has been invaluable for the completion of this project.</s><s>First and foremost, my

frescoes are a diagrammatic image of the cosmic laws binding terrestrial to celestial bodies.</s><s>They are framed by an architectural grid which forms both the mechanism of the diagram\\'s internal

transforming the space into an extension of the frescoes\\' vision of cosmic order.</s><s>It was here that Padua\\'s civic tribunals were conducted-mechanisms for judicial order that parallel the frescoes\\' representation of macrocosmic order.</s><s>To understand the function of the astrological cycle in the Sala di Ragione we must take account not only of its iconographic content, but of how the astrological cycle acted on the bodies and lives of Paduan citizens, both through its tangible influence on the architectural order of the Sala and its intertwinement with a legal practice that was informed by astrology.</s></p><p><s>The extant fresco cycle in the Sala della Ragione was painted ca.</s><s>1425-1435 by the Paduan artist Nicolò Miretto and an anonymous Ferrarese artist.</s><s>The quattrocento cycle was executed after a major fire of 1420 destroyed an earlier astrological cycle by Giotto di Bondone (ca.</s><s>1309-1312), which was painted on the same site but

shifted from an independent commune, to a signoria under the Carrara family, to a subject community under the Venetians.</s><s>Each fresco cycle proffers a different model of astrological theory and practice, attesting to the various ways that astrology was intertwined with institutions of socio-political control, as well as the shifting place of astrology within the natural and political cosmology of the city.</s></p><p><s>While studies on scientific imagery in the medieval and early modern worlds frequently focus on manuscripts, my focus is instead on monumental pictorial cycles.</s><s>I contend that it is through these monumental works integrated into spaces that serve as stages for political and social life that abstract astrological theorems come to act as real agents in the lived experiences of Paduans.</s><s>My time in Rome has furnished me with the opportunity to consult comparative and archival materials both in Rome and Padua.</s><s>But most influential for me has been the opportunity to consider the relation between these monumental pictorial cycles and their architectural environments.</s><s>In reproduction these cycles are decontextualized, flattened, and their powerful impact on space and the body is lost.</s><s>My experience and close observation of these spaces has allowed me to rethink my approach.</s><s>I have come to understand that it is by considering these works as fully integrated with their architectural context that we can understand their true power and function.</s><s>These integrated \"pictorial spaces\" are the real agents for the dissemination of astrology\\'s celestial forces, spaces In the late 1330s, while the popular preacher Venturino of Bergamo was barred from preaching, he began a correspondence with his followers.</s><s>Having led a pilgrimage of thousands to Rome in 1336, Catholic authorities had revoked Venturino\\'s preaching license, mistaking his pious intent for insurrection.</s><s>After his death, his biographer wrote that some who had received his letters \"were cured from diverse illnesses by reading, or touching, or seeing his letters.\"</s><s>Despite Venturino\\'s contested ministry, his supporters remained convinced of his holiness and divine inspiration.</s><s>His disciples believed his letters were proxies for his censured voice and manifestations of his saintly authority which, like a relic, could perform miracles for those who possessed them.</s><s>My dissertation investigates the role of written correspondence in constructing spiritual authority and advancing religious reform in late medieval Italy.</s><s>In particular, I am investigating the letters of spiritual direction which reforming leaders of the Dominican Order wrote to their disciples during the 14th and 15th centuries in Italy.</s></p><p><s>My project especially examines the ways in which medieval people engaged with these letters as physical objects.</s><s>This requires studying the 14th-and 15th-century manuscripts into which people hand-copied and bound the letters for future generations of readers.</s><s>During my Rome Prize fellowship I have been able to continue conducting my research at rare book libraries in Rome, Siena, and Florence.</s><s>When examining a book, I pay attention to the size of the manuscript, the quality of the materials or handwriting used to compile it, which other texts bookmakers bound with the letters in a given manuscript, and whether 14th-and 15th-century readers had inserted notes to the margins.</s><s>By doing this, I hope to address who it was that continued reading these texts for decades after their authors had died?</s><s>What did these letters mean to later readers?</s><s>How did they adapt them to new uses?</s><s>And in what ways could late medieval people use the letters to shape both their memories of the letters\\' authors and their own communal identities?</s></p><p><s>The quality and size of most of the manuscripts I have examined suggest that they were typically part of libraries in monasteries or convents, available for members of the community to use.</s><s>This is confirmed by notes in a few of the books identifying them with specific monastic institutions.</s><s>I have also found that the letters of spiritual direction which bookmakers most often chose to copy and preserve were those which male and female reformers wrote to women.</s><s>These they often bound beside letters which the ancient church father St. Jerome of Stridon had written to penitent women one thousand years earlier.</s><s>I suggest that by doing this, the bookmakers were arguing that the religious reforms they supported were not novel innovations but instead reached back to an ancient and authoritative Christian tradition.</s><s>I have also identified in some manuscripts accent marks which readers placed into the texts, revealing that individuals would read the letters out loud likely to the entire monastic community as they gathered together to eat their meals.</s><s>Further, by recording the hundreds of identical notations scribbled in the margins of a few manuscripts, I have sought to identify the particular spiritual themes on which readers meditated and While Sauma made little headway in convincing the pope to preach a Crusade, he did manage to arouse suspicion that he was a heretic.</s><s>Sauma had a distinct understanding from Western theologians on the relationship between the human and divine sides of Jesus.</s><s>While in Rome, some cardinals interrogated him in an attempt to expose his objectionable beliefs.</s><s>The linguistic barrier, the cardinals\\' confusion over how he deviated from their creed, and Sauma\\'s insistence that he was not there on a religious mission saved Sauma from any condemnation of heresy.</s><s>Yet in spite of fundamental questions related to the teachings of his church, Sauma was still allowed to publicly celebrate Mass in Rome according to his church\\'s rite, and on Palm Sunday, to receive the pope\\'s Eucharist.</s><s>Sauma further performed a Mass in front of King Edward I of England.</s><s>These were not normally things that orthodox Christians would have been permitted to do with a heretic.</s><s>What this anecdote suggests is that Western European clergy put more emphasis on belief than practice: it was more important what one believed about God, not how one worshiped him.</s></p><p><s>My study seeks to find the intellectual background to put Sauma\\'s story into a broader context.</s><s>To what degree did Western European intellectuals in the Middle Ages tolerate diverse forms of worship?</s><s>What were the limits of their tolerance?</s><s>I am closely reading intellectuals who wrote on this theme from Augustine in ca.</s><s>400 to Nicholas of Cusa in 1453.</s><s>My initial findings suggest that a majority of thinkers opted to tolerate diverse forms of worship, even those who would say that the pope\\'s liturgy was the ideal form.</s><s>The same writers would never have accepted a free-for-all when it came to ecclesiastical teaching.</s><s>There was a need to celebrate important festivals, like Jesus\\' passion and resurrection, but far fewer universally accepted guidelines of how to do so.</s><s>One had to recognize certain authorities in formulating liturgy like Scripture and clerical tradition, but this still left much up to the local level.</s><s>In most liturgical customs the clergy had freedom to choose, and the multiplicity of worship on the ground demonstrates that they took advantage of this freedom.</s><s>So depending on where one attended church, different prayers, music, and readings were heard.</s><s>The diversity extended to the form of baptism, the frequency of reception of the Eucharist, and the periods dictated for fasting.</s><s>No attempt was made to censure these divergent customs when they appeared in standard liturgical handbooks.</s><s>By this argument, I hope to demonstrate that one cannot when analyzing medieval religion speak about belief and practice as if they were always two sides of the same coin; the relationship between the two was complicated, and it cannot be said that belief always directly informed practice or vice versa.</s><s>In addition, I wish to problematize the idea that Western Europe starting in the 12th century was a monolithic \"persecuting society,\" especially when it came to religion.</s><s>People were willing to tolerate more difference in religious practice than has normally been recognized.</s><s>The post-Fascist transition is still today a controversial period in Italian culture and history, subject to increasing historical, political, and juridical research.</s><s>Neorealist films and literature

a constellation of ideas, embodied dispositions, experiences, and meanings; a notion that is grounded in a cultural history of the Moroccan plains and plateaus, and entangled with an Arab identity associated with a Bedouin past.</s></p><p><s>In grappling with a notion of the rural that is both intensely local and part of a transnational network, this project aims to provide a different point of entry, through sound, to explore burning political questions in an emblematic geo-cultural zone where historically determined differences between North and South are increasingly acute: the Mediterranean.</s><s>In reorienting readers to the layering of the sound of l-\\'ǝrubiya into the Mediterranean, I argue that an ethnography centered on migrant Moroccan men in Italy provides a solid basis for reflection on a critical sonorous undercurrent reshaping the contemporary Mediterranean.</s><s>By linking l-\\'ǝrubiya to a postcolonial notion of this sea by way of contemporary Arab thought, this book posits that the sound of l-\\'ǝrubiya voices a conflict of transformation, challenging a hegemonic idea of modernity, late capitalism, European migration politics, ideas of citizenship and belonging in Europe and the contemporary Mediterranean.</s><s>To place l-\\'ǝrubiya at the center of an ethnomusicological analysis means to examine how a particular migration impacts the formation of the contemporary Mediterranean through a construct of the rural in sound, whose resonances continue to be meaningful in the everyday lives of migrant Moroccan men in Italy.</s></p><p><s>This notion of the rural is associated with a sound whose timbre is thought to be unaffected by urban influences and, as such, tied to a set of aesthetics that is said to reflect the roughness of rural life, the land, the environment, the hard work of the peasants, their verbal expressions, and the use of a vernacular Arabic characteristic of the region.</s><s>A sound that, just as significantly, is entangled with a construction of masculinity defined in relation to the sense of duty a man shows toward his family and his community, the respect he has earned in both the private and the public sphere, his generosity, his physical but also moral strength, and, last but not least, his virility.</s><s>Manhood, in fact, is critical to l-\\'ǝrubiya.</s></p><p><s>This complex notion of l-\\'ǝrubiya is entrenched in two related traditional musico-poetic genres, \\'aiṭa and \\'abidat rma, and in their contemporary renditions classified nowadays as sh\\'abi; a category at the juncture between the folk and the popular that questions Western ontological categories of tradition and modernity in music.</s><s>In this project, the sound of l-\\'ǝrubiya refers to the ways in which this complex notion is voiced, performed, listened, understood, and experienced in reference to these genres.</s><s>Focusing on the multiple concepts intertwined in the Arab concept of ṣawt, my analysis engages with sound, music, song, poetry, language, voice, and its corporal connotation.</s></p><p><s>This project is concerned with a complex geography of space, with the dialectical relationship between the colonial and the postcolonial Mediterranean, tradition and modernity, the rural and the marine, the Moroccan countryside and the Mediterranean, and in the way in which this dialectic is played out through music and sound by different generations of migrant Moroccan men in Italy.</s><s>Anchored at the intersection of ethnomusicology, history, memory, affect and poetics, the project aims to introduce the voices and the perspectives of these migrants in order to understand what it means to live in the contemporary Mediterranean.</s><s>It argues that through the sound of the rural it is possible to examine the complex processes involved in redefining center-periphery relationships in the Mediterranean, in a crucial arena in which conflicting notions about Europe, citizenship, subjectivity and belonging, are being forged in the midst of the current political turmoil and anxiety over Muslim migration.</s></p><p><s>AleSSAndrA dismissed as a confessional reading of hagiography onto Rome\\'s topography, my work seeks to take these excavations at face value.</s><s>I emphasize how the Church reacted to and employed shifting criteria and methods used to establish \"truth\" in the post-Reformation period, thereby exploring the intersection of religion and science, invention and truth, and object and text.</s><s>Bodies of early Christian martyrs excavated from underneath tombs in several of Rome\\'s churches were deemed authentic, for example, not because of miracles or the reading of signs of sanctity onto their corpses.</s><s>Rather, they were \"positively\" identified based on a haphazard reading of anatomical terminology onto their bodies.</s><s>Archival records, manuscripts, and printed histories tell us how bones were carefully extracted under the eyes of witnesses, studied, sorted, and displayed.</s><s>Moreover, detailed analyses of topography, and the discovery of objects and materials such as sepulchers, piping, ash, and mortar were used to show that subterranean spaces had been the homes of early Christians, which were later converted into churches.</s><s>I have found that the most pronounced excavations occurred under the Barberini in the 1620s and 1630s: bodies under the altars of the churches of Santa Bibiana, Santi Quattro Coronati, and Santa Martina; the uncovering of an oratory supposedly built by Pope Sylvester under San Martino in Monti; and the union of the supposed body of Pope Caius from the catacombs with ruins thought to have been his home on the Quirinal.</s><s>In these cases, the early Christian history of Rome was not only substantiated, but in some cases rewritten according to the bodies, objects, and spaces that were dug up throughout Rome\\'s center.</s><s>Archaeology therefore allowed patrons to tell more triumphant versions of the histories of the martyrs, popes, and church building by making them more physically present in the city.</s><s>Patronage of Christian antiquities was integral to the cultural and political patronage of the Barberini, yet has been an understudied aspect of Urban VIII\\'s pontificate.</s></p><p><s>The time spent in Rome has allowed me to simultaneously expand and focus my project by granting me special access to sites and archives, and conversations with local experts.</s><s>Visits to Rome\\'s churches, catacombs, and ancient structures with other fellows have given me a wider understanding of the interaction between monuments, history, invention, and power that frames my project.</s><s>Invaluable conversations and collaboration with fellows and residents at the Academy have prompted to me think about my project in new ways across time and discipline.</s></p><p><s>tAliA They were thought lost before Paul O.

for geometry\\'s relationship to the mind, imagination, and reason, for the relationship of mathematics to theology and ethics, and for a complete ordering of mathematics and knowledge according to universal principles (a mathesis universalis).</s><s>They also contain a large number of pseudepigraphic texts in an artificially archaic Doric Greek that were attributed to Pythagoreans before Plato,

mathematical theories useful for interpreting Plato and proposes a systematic order to knowledge and mathematical sciences.</s><s>Iamblichus was one of the most influential philosophers in the later movement commonly called Neoplatonism.</s><s>He wrote about philosophy, religion, mathematics, and organized a philosophical curriculum to study Plato and Aristotle that was adopted in schools throughout the Mediterranean.</s><s>His De secta Pythagorica once contained ten volumes.</s><s>Of these only the first four, which Ficino translates, are extant.</s><s>Volumes five, six, and seven

Rambaud, who asked, \"d\\'ou vient cet oubli ou cette ingratitude de l\\'Europe?\"</s><s>Gustave Schlumberger, later commenting on Constantin Porphyrogénète, described it as an epiphany for the scholars of his generation-and they proceeded with serious study of Byzantium.</s><s>Soon, scholarly interest spread to larger audiences: in 1874 Augustin Marrast wrote the Esquisses byzantines, a collection of tableau vivants set in the glory days of Constantinople.</s><s>His book quickly became a bestseller and he was praised by the critics.</s><s>That same year, Paul Abadie won the design

style by Alphonse Mucha, the pièce had an astounding success: 257 encore performances and tours in the United States and Great Britain.</s><s>Thus, Rambaud\\'s \"renaissance des études byzantines\" acted as the catalyst for the spread of Byzantinomania outside academia.</s></p><p><s>My time at the American Academy in Rome was spent writing the manuscript for a book about the Exposition

of the Italo-oriented Esposizione d\\'arte italo-bizantina held at the abbey of Grottaferrata in 1905.</s><s>The book aims to explore the importance of the exhibition, which marked a pivotal turning point in the history of Byzantine studies for multiple reasons.</s><s>First, practically every moment of the cultural history of Byzantium had its artistic representative (e.g., Late Antique ivory diptychs, coptic tapestries, post-Byzantine icons, illuminated manuscripts) in order to enhance the varietas of Byzantine art against its numerous detractors and against the stereotyped representation of Byzantium evoked by Victorien Sardou\\'s Theodora and the so-called Romans byzantins.</s><s>Second, it gathered together the whole world of connoisseurs: scholars, museum curators, collectors, and

truly understand what is in the name Cesare Zavattini, it might be useful to forget, for the moment, his association with filmmaker Vittorio De Sica, his work as screenwriter and editor on famous postwar films such as Shoeshine, Bicycle Thieves, Miracle in Milan, Umberto D., and his role as tutelary deity and apostle of neorealism.</s><s>The name Cesare Zavattini, or Za for short, would be better approached as a field of creative energy fueling and often short-circuiting the Italian cultural scene and its cinema during the last century with reverberations across global cinema.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>AN EVERYDAY BIOGRAPHY</head><p><s>Given his profound belief in the material basis of all human life and experience, it seems appropriate to enter the planet Zavattini by dwelling on some of those earthly elements that could shed light on the artist\\'s temperament, cultural background, and visual poetics.</s><s>\"Really to understand Zavattini the man as well as Zavattini the writer, one must know something about his birthplace,\" so William Weaver prefaces the 1970 collection Sequences from a Cinematic Life, the first book-length English translation of Zavattini\\'s writings.</s></p><p><s>Luzzara, where Zavattini was born in 1902, is a small agricultural town on the banks of the Po River in the province of Reggio Emilia.</s><s>There is nothing remarkable about Luzzara; it is provincial Italy at its most anonymous.</s><s>Nonetheless, leafing through the pages of Un paese, the photobook that Zavattini created in 1955 with American photographer Paul Strand, we encounter this same Luzzara as a land of epic landscapes and quietly dignified people whose simple words draw a compelling picture of 1950s Italy.</s><s>It is in the seemingly unremarkable, everyday world of Luzzara that Zavattini learned early on one of the revolutionary tenets of his poetics that eventually shaped postwar cinema-the banal does not exit.</s><s>Once invested with an attentive eye and ear, the most ordinary reality becomes extraordinary and revelatory, an infinite repertory of images \"worth narrating in every moment.\"</s></p><p><s>In Luzzara, Zavattini\\'s family ran an elegant café and pastry shop in the center of town.</s><s>Always busy and always struggling with debts, the entire family worked in the popular café, leading an existence that left little space for intimate and private moments.</s><s>\"The caffettieri <ref type=\"bibr\">[baristas]</ref> do not have a home even when they have one, one even eats among clients, cohabitants,\" Zavattini will reminisce years later in Going Back.</s><s>The open space of the café, where the whole community comes and goes as in a seaport, where words flow with the coffee and liquors, where stories are heard and told, is a space of meeting and listening which profoundly shaped Zavattini\\'s poetics.</s><s>The cinema of the encounter, his Utopia, at once aesthetic and political, of civic cohabitation in a living space that is shared and for which we share responsibility, finds its roots here.</s><s>In Luzzara, living the life of the caffettieri, Zavattini developed his unique art of storytelling that introduced into Italian literature and then cinema the view from the street, the world seen from the eyes of the \"common man,\" a direct and simple language, resonating with the living voices of people.</s></p><p><s>After Luzzara, Zavattini lived in the northern city of Bergamo with an uncle, then in Rome, in whose vicinity the family moved during WWI, and then in Parma where, after dropping out of law school, he started his career as a journalist for a local newspaper.</s><s>A voracious reader but mediocre student, Zavattini found in the streets, variety theaters, and cinemas his true university.</s><s>Before Charlie Chaplin, his idol was the Italian stage performer Leopoldo Fregoli, the greatest and most versatile quick-change artist of his day, famous for his extraordinary impersonations and rapid change of roles.</s><s>Fregoli, the artist as a protean being, dashing on and off stage, resonates with the ebullient artistic temperament of Zavattini.</s><s>In the space of a few years during the 1930s, he too would undergo swift and amazing transformations: from obscure provincial journalist to the most acclaimed fiction writer in Italy, popular magazine writer and editor, cultural trendsetter and, toward the end of the decade, sought-after screenwriter.</s><s>Then, in the postwar period, he emerged as one of the main figures of neorealism, theorist of a modern ethical cinema, engaging tirelessly in cultural and political initiatives that shook the Italian cinematic establishment.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>FOR A CINEMA OF THE BLIND AND VISIONARIES The Forgotten Lessons of Cesare Zavattini by Giuliana Minghelli</head><p><s>Three new books detail the screenwriter\\'s importance in Italian neorealism and also reveal his influence as a democratic force in cinema in Spain, Cuba, Latin America, and elsewhere throughout the world.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>A NEW ENGLISH TRANSLATION</head><p><s>This long and complex history is finally made accessible to the English public through a series of books published in 2021 by Bloomsbury Academic: Cesare Zavattini Selected Writings, a two-volume collection of texts representative of Zavattini\\'s volcanic output, translated and curated by David Brancaleone; and Cesare Zavattini\\'s Neo-realism and the Afterlife of an Idea: An Intellectual Biography, a companion volume by the same author.</s><s>These volumes help flesh out an artist who usually appears as a footnote in the history of postwar cinema and thus fill a long-standing gap in film history in the English language.</s><s>Reopening a conversation on Zavattini, a polymath working across a wide range of media and a deeply original, if unsystematic, thinker, will highlight his contribution to the theory and practice of modern cinema, putting it into a dialogue with more familiar postwar voices such as André Bazin, Sigfried Kracauer, and the better-known Italian Pier Paolo Pasolini.</s></p><p><s>The first volume of Cesare Zavattini Selected Writings contains Zavattini\\'s fiction and screenplays, materials translated for the first time in English.</s><s>It includes excerpts from Zavattini\\'s early novels Let\\'s Talk a Lot about <ref type=\"bibr\">Me (1931)</ref> and The Poor are <ref type=\"bibr\">Mad (1937)</ref> and the 1941 collection of short stories I am the Devil, and an extensive array of scenarios ranging from his first in 1936, The Nervous Tic Clinic, to the 1981 scenario for Zavattini\\'s first debut as actor and director, The Truuuuth (interestingly Zavattini\\'s career in film starts and ends with stories set in mental asylums).</s><s>The scenarios offer a comprehensive view of Zavattini\\'s rich and varied input to Italian cinema.</s><s>In comparison, the prose selection, which Brancaleone rightly argues is central to understanding Zavattini\\'s comic vein, unique mix of realism and fantasy, and modernist writing style, seems inadequate.</s><s>The selected passages could have been more extensive and better contextualized regarding the structure and plot of the books they come from to afford the reader a better understanding of how Zavattini\\'s narrative in the Thirties both foreshadows and differs from his later neorealism.</s></p><p><s>The second volume of Selected Writings includes a representative corpus of Zavattini\\'s theoretical and critical interventions in the form of essays, interviews, and confer-ence papers.</s><s>Starting from the prewar writings, the bulk of the materials cover the period of neorealism and the subsequent evolution of Zavattini\\'s idea of ethical cinema, particularly his activism in the Free Newsreels Collective and counterinformation movement of the Sixties.</s><s>The materials coming from two Italian collections of 1979, Neorealism etc. and the Cinematographic Diary, appear in English for the first time except for \"Some Ideas on Cinema,\" and \"Thesis on Neorealism.\"</s><s>The volume also includes unpublished correspondence, some of it documenting Zavattini\\'s collaboration with representatives of Cuban and Latin American cinema.</s></p><p><s>While praised for the terseness of his fiction writing, as a thinker and speaker Zavattini was torrential in his output.</s><s>Ideas and initiatives came fast and furious to Zavattini only to be shelved or abandoned with equal speed.</s><s>Being an editor of his work is a daunting task.</s><s>While praising Brancaleone\\'s overall selection of materials, the organization of the two volumes of translations could have been tighter and better integrated.</s><s>With an artist like Zavattini, who disregarded boundaries separating media, genres, and disciplines, and who worked synergistically on fiction, screenplays, and theory, the choice to separate fiction from theory is at least questionable.</s><s>This division also creates a lot of overlap and unnecessary redundancy in Brancaleone\\'s editorial notes, with the potential of diluting the impact of the texts and confusing the reader.</s><s>Similar organizational problems surface in the intellectual biography, where, to take an example, at least three chapters are dedicated to separate yet related discussions of the Italia mia project.</s><s>The story of this road movie/ethnographic documentary to encounter Italy is crucial for understanding Zavattini\\'s activities in the postwar cultural environment, but since Italia mia did not materialize into a film (though it was the seed for the stunning photobook with Paul Strand), the story did not need to be told three times over.</s></p><p><s>Most unfortunately, however, this important and timely contribution to film and cultural studies did not receive a careful review or proofreading at the editorial level.</s><s>Many repetitions, errors of attribution, and even spelling hinder its value as a reference.</s><s>On the other hand, even considering the academic nature of the publication, the reference apparatus is at times so intrusive as to make the reading needlessly arduous.</s><s>Finally, the absence of any visuals in a book on \"the founder of visual culture in Italy\" is lamentable.</s><s>A selection of photographs, film stills, as well as of Zavattini\\'s paintings-he started painting in 1939 in a naïf/abstract style and continued throughout his life-would have greatly illuminated the reading.</s></p><p><s>Despite these shortcomings, Brancaleone\\'s work has the merit to document Zavattini\\'s richness and originality and to detail the profound, often overlooked influence that he exerted not just on Italian but also world cinema.</s><s>Thanks to Brancaleone\\'s original research in the Zavattini Archives, we have for the first time a detailed account of his intense collaboration with Spanish, Cuban, and Latin American cinema, thus documenting the direct influence that neorealism exerted on the rise of movements like Third Cinema.</s><s>Brancaleone\\'s critical presentation drives home the fact that Zavattini\\'s contribution has staying power.</s><s>While it sheds light on postwar cinema, refreshing the debate surrounding it, his theory and practice open a compelling dialogue with many contemporary practices, from slow cinema and ethnographic cinema to the engaged documentary.</s><s>Zavattini still matters.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>WHY ZAVATTINI?</head><p><s>Why is it that, except for the 1970 publication of Sequences from a Cinematic Life and a couple of essays, Zavattini did not receive sustained critical attention in the English-speaking world?</s><s>Brancaleone convincingly explains Zavattini\\'s marginalization through his connection with a clichéd idea of neorealism as simple social realism.</s><s>Although critics such as André Bazin and Gilles Deleuze have long dismantled this reductionist reading, the cliché has persisted.</s><s>A recent body of studies on both sides of the Atlantic (which Brancaleone unfortunately does not engage) have reopened the question of postfascist cinema and its aesthetics.</s><s>Within this discussion, Zavattini has become a key figure for recognizing the role of neorealism in opening the trajectory of today\\'s cinema rather than as a tradition we have superseded.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>First: Regrounding Cinema</head><p><s>Zavattini wrote his most incisive interventions at times of great upheaval-on the eve of the Second World War, in the immediate postwar, and during the Sixties counterculture.</s><s>The way in which he raised fundamental questions pertaining to the nature of cinema and its task within an urgently lived historical moment continue to resonate.</s></p><p><s>The 1949 Perugia conference on Neorealism took place during the escalation of the Cold War when the new cinema was under attack from the censorship of the Christian Democratic government.</s><s>It was an international event attended by filmmakers, photographers, and critics, including Joris Ivens, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Paul Strand, and Georges Sadoul, along with the leading figures of Italian cinema and culture.</s><s>Zavattini delivered a compelling opening address entitled \"Cinema and the Modern Man\" that put cinema on trial and raised the question of its future.</s></p><p><s>To put it simply, cinema had failed…How many films were made during the long vigil, in preparation for the great slaughter?</s><s>An incalculable number in fifty years: 1895-1944.</s><s>Fifty years of cinema.</s><s>It sounds like a tombstone…Cinema didn\\'t help us. 1   The experience of the war and the fall of fascism had taught a radical lesson.</s></p><p><s>Surrounded by war rubble, we realized that we\\'d spent too few images to open our neighbor\\'s eyes…In no time at all, [cinema] succeeded in pushing viewers as far away as possible from themselves…Having deserted their own surroundings, viewers felt they were citizens from a country suspended in mid-air, a place where they could hear the cries of sufferings of invented characters on the screen, but not those of the people in whose company they\\'d crowded buses and stores.</s></p><p><s>For Zavattini, emerging from the darkness of a movie theater is synonymous with leaving the darkness of fascism.</s><s>After having lived a life as sleepwalkers, the citizen-spectators return to earth.</s><s>After the war, cinema cannot be the same.</s><s>The agenda for Zavattini is clearly set-to atone for the past and reground cinema historically and ethically.</s><s>\"Neorealism is by now the conscience of cinema.\"</s><s>This meant that a radical rupture in the understanding of culture, spectacle, and spectator was in order.</s></p><p><s>Those years and Zavattini\\'s words seem very distant from us.</s><s>Nonetheless, in 1998, at another fifty-year distance, Jean-Luc Godard, reflecting on cinema and the tragic history of the twentieth century after completing his Histoire(s) du cinéma, echoed Zavattini\\'s conclusions: \"Cinema totally fell short of its duty…It is like the parable of the good servant who died from not being utilized.</s><s>Cinema is a means of expression from which expression disappeared.</s><s>Only the medium remained.\" 2 But, while for Godard cinema could return to its mission by way of the archive and the editing table (redeeming the image by actualizing what had remained implicit in the cinematic vision), for Zavattini, in 1949 it was in the direct encounter with the world, in the space between the camera and reality, that cinema could start over again.</s></p><p><s>\"Let it be Lumière\" (the title of an essay by Dai Vaughan), 3 was the battle cry of Zavattini in 1949, when he argued that cinema was to return to its roots, when the world lay before the camera unscripted.</s></p><p><s>It seems to us that we are about to rediscover the original value of our image in three dimensions.</s><s>But then, this is what cinema was from when it first opened its lens to the light of the world.</s><s>That was when it gave equal importance to everything, and everything was worth fixing on the plate.</s><s>That was the most uncontaminated and promising moment in cinema history.</s><s>Slowly, reality began to resurface, although it was buried under a pile of myths.</s><s>Cinema began its creation of the world.</s><s>A tree here, an old man there, a house, a man eating, a man sleeping, a man weeping.</s></p><p><s>From Rossellini\\'s Rome, Open <ref type=\"bibr\">City (1945)</ref> to Umberto D. (1952)-roughly the beginning and end of the high season of neorealismwhat Zavattini called the cinema of encounter unfolded as an ongoing reminder of the materiality and contingency of our looking, what critic Sandro Bernardi summarized in this imperative-\"Now, here, you, are watching these things.\"</s><s>This documentarist vision challenging the boundary separating fiction from nonfiction is at the heart of the revolution of neorealism.</s><s>As we have entered an age of momentous geopolitical as well as environmental transformations, and at a time when the proliferation of media interfaces and modes of image production and consumption has endowed the word cinema with an uncertain status (nostalgic, expanded, dissolved), Zavattini\\'s reflections on what cinema is and could be, the nature of its tasks within a time of upheaval, continues to challenge us.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Second: What is Reality?</head><p><s>The recent book by Jill Godmilow, Kill the Documentary: A Letter to Filmmakers, Students, and Scholars (Columbia University Press, 2022), is the latest reminder that the documentarist vision at the heart of postfascist cinema is still an embattled and contested terrain.</s><s>Although Zavattini is not quoted in Godmilow\\'s volume, I would argue that Zavattini\\'s idea of cinema-precariously and productively suspended between reality and fiction, open to contaminations across various media and genres (the diary form, the cinema journal, the photobook)-and his sophisticated understanding of reality, make Zavattini\\'s reflection central to the contemporary debate on a documentary form that is performative and experimental, yet not necessarily, as Godmilow proposes, postrealist.</s><s>What matters, as always, is to clarify the terms of the discussion.</s></p><p><s>The big stumbling block in the discussions of neorealism, as well as the documentary, is the semantic field of the real, reality, realism.</s><s>In his presentation, Brancaleone rightly insists on clearing away the misconceptions surrounding the \"realism\" in neorealism, a set of deeply engrained prejudices that, as noted before, has pigeonholed postwar Italian cinema and Zavattini with it.</s><s>Far from evoking a naive, mimetic notion of the real, Zavattini\\'s cinema of the encounter proposes reality not as a space of representation but of invention where the perceived world and imagination meet in mutual interrogation.</s><s>It is precisely because of this complex understanding of reality that Italian postwar cinema figures largely in major reflections on modern cinema.</s><s>From the start, André Bazin rejected a codified, prescriptive notion of \"reality\" as the object of neorealism, replacing it with the deceptively simple and open \"what is.\"</s><s>By doing so, he shifted the focus from content to form, reality being the result of an aesthetic engagement of the camera with the world.</s><s>As Gilles Deleuze wrote later, in neorealism \"the real was no longer represented or reproduced, but \\'aimed at\\'\"; it was not an already known real but an ambiguous, yet-to-be deciphered \"what is.\"</s></p><p><s>By focusing as it does on the everyday, the ephemeral, the fragmentary, the contingent, Zavattini\\'s cinema of the encounter is at one and the same time realist and modernist, breaking established aesthetic boundaries.</s><s>To borrow the words of John Berger on Michelangelo Antonioni, what we encounter in the image-worlds of neorealism is \"something so real that it does not yet have a name.\" 4 Doing away with an objective, dogmatic notion of reality associated with nineteenth-century \"realism,\" the \"real\" understood as a mystery and a project is what we should keep in mind as we discuss Zavattini and postwar Italian cinema.</s></p><p><s>Let\\'s look for instance at an amazing short piece entitled \"The Best Dreams,\" made available for the first time in Brancaleone\\'s translation.</s><s>In this seminal essay, which originally appeared in the magazine Cinema in 1940, Zavattini posits \"blindness\" as an organizing principle behind cinematic vision, thus evoking a complex notion of realism predicated on invisibility and fantasy.</s></p><p><s>I often close my eyes during a film and try to guess what is going to happen next, both in terms of film technique and the events of the story…A pedestrian, trite and logical movie, followed with this lowering of eyelids, always justifies our presence…you are left with the angelic doubt that in those moments of blindness brilliant actions might have taken place; in other words, we make allowances, as we do with people given to long silences, since there is always poetry in parsimony…Deficiencies enliven the imagination.</s></p><p><s>Cinema is the result of a double vision: images flow before the eyes, contained in a visible and logical straitjacket, while others are projected behind the eyelids.</s><s>\"Blindness,\" the ability to see beyond appearances, to combine reality and imagination, emerges as the organizing force of a new vision both for the spectator and filmmaker.</s><s>So Zavattini continues:</s></p><p><s>Dreams belong to the blind and visionaries.</s><s>A film that was entirely based on dreams would be an important documentary, even for future generations.</s><s>Otherwise how would they know what citizens of these warlike times were dreaming?…But</s><s>no fade in, no slow motion, no surrealism…for our dreams are crystal clear and fierce…We need to drop the tricks of the trade, the special effects, the filters, the endless subterfuges, so dear to Méliès.</s><s>We shall discover the marvel in ourselves and express it without marvel: the best dreams are without fog, they are as visible as the veins in leaves.</s></p><p><s>With a startlingly momentous insight, Zavattini rejects a cinema defined by the regime of visibility to posit invisibility as cinema\\'s intrinsic structural element.</s><s>Distancing himself from a stereotype of surrealism, Zavattini imagines a new realism bound to the world\\'s materiality yet veined by the imagination.</s><s>The visions of the blind are not a flight to an elsewhere but an immersion in the real, which is of necessity enigmatic and mysterious.</s><s>The dreams of this new realism are dreams with the senses wide awake.</s><s>This subtle yet momentous shift within the notion of realism is what is contained in the \"neo\" of neorealism.</s><s>Zavattini\\'s notion of a cinema of double vision short-circuits deeply held notions about Italian postwar cinema.</s><s>Neorealism, a cinema of simple stories of street urchins and unemployed workers, relying on documentary-style filming of postwar ruins and dusty streets drenched in the anonymous light of the everyday, seems a cinema bound to the visibility of an absolute present.</s><s>Zavattini\\'s cinema of \"the blind and visionaries,\" however, suggests how the profilmic materiality of postwar Italy is both the site of a visible realism and emotions, memory, dreams \"visible as the veins in the leaves.\"</s><s>But what is exactly the blindness that weighs on Zavattini\\'s eyelids?</s><s>Elsewhere I have suggested how Italian postwar cinema is born from a split between a commitment to the documentary visibility of the present and a silent engagement with a yet unspeakable past. 5</s><s>Here is where neorealism differs from the original vision of Lumière.</s><s>As cinema at the end of the war opens its eyes on the world again, it finds a reality pre-occupied by mourning, trauma, and guilt.</s><s>The past is the weight on Zavattini\\'s eyelids.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Third: Cinema as Democratic Practice</head><p><s>As the title of Brancaleone\\'s intellectual biography makes clear, far from being circumscribed to the immediate postwar, for Zavattini neorealism was a life-long project.</s><s>Having been declared the conscience of cinema, neorealism became the project for an ethical cinema whose potentialities lay in the future.</s><s>In the Fifties, when one by one Italian filmmakers, under pressure of political censorship from the ruling Christian Democratic Party, steered away from a declaredly committed cinema, Zavattini kept at it.</s><s>1952, the year of Umberto D. and the vicious attack on it by future prime minister Giulio Andreotti (who famously declared that neorealist cinema had to stop \"washing the dirty linen in public\"), Zavattini published some of his most important theoretical reflections on the new cinema.</s></p><p><s>In the writings of the period, he develops a sustained critique of cinema as a cultural institution at the formal level-challenging the straitjackets of scripts, genres, and aesthetic codes-and at the political and economic level-denouncing the suffocating joint hold of censorship and industry.</s><s>As a response to these strictures, Zavattini started exploring new possible forms that the cinema of encounter could take.</s><s>To bypass the control of the production system, Zavattini argued that the gap separating thought and filming is too big and that the camera should confront, shadow, and narrate contemporary reality without mediations.</s><s>Zavattini called for a \"cinema of immediacy\" and the adoption of the diary form, a writing that possesses the swiftness of the movie camera and thus is most able to \"stay at the heels of time.\"</s><s>The diary, he declared in 1950, is \"the most complete and authentic expression of cinema\" (\"Scrap Scripts\").</s><s>Zavattini\\'s appeal resonates profoundly with Jonas Mekas\\'s experimental work, as well as with the contemporary flourishing of first-person cinema and the essay film.</s></p><p><s>The 1953 anthology film Love in the City, with the reenactment of news stories featuring the actual protagonists, the shadowing of real-life people, and grafting the magazine format onto the structure of the film, is the first showcase of this cinema of immediacy, what Zavattini also called a \"Flash Film.\"</s><s>But the fullest realization of this idea of cinema is the experience of the Cinegiornali (Newsreels).</s><s>After The Newsreel for Peace in 1963, the most compelling examples of this initiative were the Free Newsreels Collective that Zavattini launched in 1967 together with a group of young filmmakers including Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Marco Bellocchio, and Bernardo Bertolucci.</s><s>In a year\\'s time in many cities throughout the country, collectives were spontaneously formed to chronicle, analyze, and critique current events.</s><s>This guerrilla cinema-variously described as \"cinema now,\" \"cinema by everyone for everyone,\" \"cinema together\"-was uneven in its results and short-lived, but some amazing works remain, such as Apollon.</s><s>Free Newsreel 2. An Occupied Factory (1969), collectively produced by the striking workers of a printing factory in Rome together with a group of young filmmakers.</s></p><p><s>In the Sixties, Zavattini became an outspoken proponent of a democratized cinematic culture that would do away with the divisions between producers and consumers, spectators and spectacle.</s><s>Already in the Fifties, Zavattini proposed a national program to distribute still cameras in the schools to empower all children to look at the world, document it, and, through the image, interrogate it.</s><s>In the next decade, he called for the distribution-this time of film cameras-to students and workers.</s><s>Technological limitations and lack of funding left Zavattini\\'s proposals unrealized.</s><s>His project hardly seems utopian today, just ahead of its time.</s><s>The ideas of the diary form, the Flash Film, and culture as a participatory realm of seemingly interchangeable producers and consumers seem to have come to fruition in our present tech-savvy, gadgetrich world of instant communication, of YouTube personal channels, Instagram, and Facebook.</s><s>It is through consumer technology, however, and not revolution or even education, that we seem to have arrived at a twenty-first-century iteration of the cinema of everyone for everyone.</s><s>How does Zavattini\\'s work give us a critical perspective on our present?</s></p><p><s>The limits of Zavattini\\'s Utopia are nested in an unthought-through contradiction.</s><s>The new ethical cinema was predicated at the same time on both immediacy and duration-\"cinema of duration\" was another slogan of those years.</s><s>In the 1950 essay decrying scripts, he writes, \"It is certainly the contemplation of reality which makes everything truly possible in cinema.</s><s>This contemplation is, in my opinion…the ethics of this cinema.\"</s><s>While revolutionizing the notion of access and production, immediacy left unaddressed the questions of spectacle and spectator.</s><s>How are stories to be told just by looking at reality?</s><s>As early as 1940, Zavattini framed the practice and poetics of the everyday as a spectacle with a memorable anecdote.</s></p><p><s>What becomes spectacle are things stilled in a planned attention.</s><s>So, for example, my uncle, who was a very wise man, never said: \"Look at the sunset.\"</s><s>Instead, he would line us up in front of the window-he\\'d often even invite some of his friends-ring a bell, and only then draw the window curtains and exclaim: \"Here is the sunset!\"</s><s>What a wonderful vision!</s><s>(\"The Best Dreams\") It is not speed but the insistence of the gaze, the attention, the conscious creation through framing of a no-matter-how-humble theater of vision, that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary.</s><s>Once again mediation is reduced to the minimum; all that is needed is a shared space charged with the consciousness of seeing.</s><s>\"Few have the patience to look and listen,\" notes Zavattini in 1953.</s><s>But exactly for that reason, modern cinema\\'s chief task is that of cultivating attentiveness.</s><s>Despite his energetic optimism, Zavattini was well aware that:</s></p><p><s>It will be hard to turn these events into spectacle.</s><s>It will require powerful human insight, both in the filmmaker, and in the viewer.</s><s>What is required is to give every single minute of man\\'s life its historical importance.</s><s>(\"Some Ideas on Cinema\")</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Love in the City is available in a RaroVideo</head><p><s>Blu-ray edition available from Kino Lorber.</s></p><p><s>The uneven results of Zavattini\\'s cinematic praxis beyond neorealism might be explained in this unproblematized coexistence of immediacy and duration, and the divide between communication and vision.</s><s>Technology, immediate access, and speed are not sufficient to change the distribution of power or the ability to know and critique the world we incessantly photograph.</s><s>Walter Benjamin\\'s warning that \"the illiteracy of the future will be the ignorance not of reading or writing, but of photography,\" resonates in Zavattini\\'s utopia as well as our present reality.</s></p><p><s>There is a place where the pedagogical mission of the new cinema is fully realized.</s><s>This is in the films that Zavattini made with De Sica.</s><s>Incidentally, Brancaleone rightly insists on the fact that, given his participation in all aspects of filming and editing, we should think of Zavattini as co-author with De Sica.</s><s>Bicycle Thieves is the best example of the \"education of the onlooker.\"</s><s>The first part of the film tells in twenty minutes, in a classical rapid-montage Hollywood style, the story of how Antonio, an unemployed Roman worker, redeems his pawned bicycle only to have it stolen his first day on a job hanging posters.</s><s>From this moment on, the film, as if dismounting from the bicycle, slows down and, in a full hour of near-real time, follows the wanderings of Antonio and his son Bruno through Rome in search of the stolen bike.</s><s>From an abstract cinematic quantity, time becomes the embodied time of the drama of being in and looking at the world.</s><s>As a result, the film works as a training of the viewer from \"a realism on wheels,\" predicated on cinematic speed, to a new kind of realism where the actors, the camera, and the viewers are ethically sharing a field of vision and a common universe of injustices, mistakes, and forgiveness.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>THE MAN OF CONTRADICTIONS</head><p><s>To present Zavattini\\'s extensive production, spanning roughly from the rise of fascism to the fall of the Berlin Wall, is a huge editorial and critical undertaking.</s><s>In the biography, Brancaleone chooses the seemingly safe path of following chronologically the unfolding of Zavattini\\'s work.</s><s>The picture that emerges of Zavattini-tireless experimenter, perpetual outsider-is both exhaustive and partial.</s><s>It tells the story of Zavattini as the man of infinite transformations, while forgetting what William Weaver called \"the man of immense contradictions.\"</s><s>Zavattini is the artist who called for immediate cinema and elimination of scripts, while working full time writing screenplays for mainstream cinema; the artist who wanted a cinema of immediacy and duration at the same time; the leading representative of neorealism who in 1949 adapted a prewar fairy tale in Miracle in Milan.</s><s>The list could go on.</s><s>These contradictions (actual or apparent) are the most compelling and productive moments of Zavattini\\'s thought and artistic practice.</s><s>Thus, for instance, Zavattini\\'s \"contradictory\" appeal to both realism and imagination allows us to rethink neorealism as \"a documentary all made of dreams.\"</s><s>In this sea of contradiction, however, there is one central tension that is life-defining for Zavattini\\'s personality and contribution-this global proponent of an ethical and democratized cinema had been one of the most successful and respected protagonists of Italian culture under the fascist regime.</s><s>It is standard practice, in order to give a few clear signposts to orient us historically, to divide the twentieth century between a pre-and postwar.</s><s>We rely automatically on this division despite its historical and theoretical evasiveness, an evasiveness which emerges when we speak instead of fascism and postfascism.</s><s>Wars end but violence and coercion linger on.</s><s>The question of how this transition should be thought-as a radical break with the past or as continuity-is still debated by historians.</s><s>Brancaleone in a way embraces both theories: the war and fall of fascism marked a radical shift in Zavattini\\'s work and poetics and Zavattini was already Zavattini in the Thirties.</s><s>Paradoxically both statements are true.</s><s>This being the case, however, a conscious, concerted effort needs to be made to acknowledge and engage with how that is meaningful, even foundational, for Zavattini\\'s work.</s></p><p><s>Zavattini\\'s passage from fascism to postfascism was not an instantaneous liberation.</s><s>It was a painful crossing which took up the rest of his life.</s><s>Using the words of critic Mino Argentieri, who curated the Italian edition of his writings, Zavattini was one of the few Italian intellectuals who tried to face the moral ruins (much more disastrous than the material devastation) which fascism left in its wake.</s></p><p><s>His hands are clean, but he feels remorse for not having done more, for having been, with his grumpy acceptance of Fascism and with a doubtful inurement, co-responsible in the deceit which had enormous repercussions.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Argentieri, 2002)</ref> Thus, there is a Zavattini to imagine the future and another to read and understand the past.</s><s>Zavattini the utopian is a man deeply scarred by history.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Under Fascism</head><p><s>The recurring image in Zavattini\\'s biography is that of the eternal outsider: the satirist who under fascism uses \"humor as a weapon\"; the filmmaker who attacks the institutions of cinema; the madman who speaks The Truuuuth.</s><s>But the reality, unpleasant as it might be, is that since the early Thirties, Zavattini had been an insider.</s><s>Deeply entrenched in fascist cultural life, through his fiction, journalism, and work in popular magazines and cinema, he greatly contributed to shaping it and was showered with recognition.</s><s>Undoubtedly, he had to struggle with censorship and constantly sweat over his initiatives in fear that they might expose him.</s><s>In those early years, as Brancaleone extensively documents, he was instrumental in creating a modern visual culture.</s><s>But his innovative impact on the format of the new illustrated popular magazine-less text, more images, more color, more scantily dressed women, more cartoons, flexible layout-could be read as an express response to working both within and against the strictures of the regime.</s></p><p><s>Despite his coexistence with the fascist regime, Zavattini\\'s temperament is essentially and profoundly antifascist.</s><s>This antifascism is not to be found so much, as is usually thought, in his comic vein-the ambiguous dissidence of jokes and cartoons were happily tolerated by the regime, as the flourishing of humoristic magazines in the Thirties clearly shows-but rather in his poetics.</s><s>What could, in fact, be more counter to fascism than his attention to the everyday, the banal, the unheroic, his willingness to take up the point of view of the common person, the subaltern?</s><s>His success in the press and cinema was due to his ability to express the immediacy and simplicity of life.</s></p><p><s>The delightful comedy he scripted for Alessandro Blasetti in 1942, Four Steps in the Clouds, is just such an example of Zavattini\\'s aspiration to tell the story of simple men and women mixed up in and ultimately trapped by the mythologies of the regime.</s><s>In a brutally hierarchical society, in which citizens were choreographed as anonymous masses, he lent a human face to the inhumanity of fascism-thus he made fascism more tolerable and, thus, arguably, he made it worse.</s><s>Neither an apologist, nor a rebel, his tight-rope act extorted a high moral price that left him deeply wounded.</s></p><p><s>His fiction writing in the Thirties, although only cryptically, denounces this malaise.</s><s>A short story written in the last years of fascism, set in an anonymous geography and environment reminiscent of Kafka\\'s universe, reveals allegorically the moral nature of the compromise that bound artists, intellectuals, and common Italians with the regime.</s><s>\"Dance at A…\" is part of the 1941 collection I am the Devil.</s><s>The action takes place at a Carnival party, safely set during the previous war.</s><s>The (male) narrator absents himself from the party with the excuse of a migraine and unbeknownst to the others returns to the dance disguised as a mysterious femme fatale.</s><s>\"I had prepared the joke very well, faking even the breasts.\"</s><s>The fascinating lady repulses all advances until the local judge in a fit of passion leads her into a waltz.</s><s>The narrator\\'s musings carry us through the scene.</s></p><p><s>My plan was to reveal my true sex at the most opportune moment, in the midst of the hall.</s><s>What fun!</s><s>The judge, encouraged by my silence, proposed to me with a heavy breath while people were looking at us maliciously.</s><s>He then squeezed me brushing my neck with his lips.</s><s>I saw his watery pupils disappear in the white of the eyes.</s><s>It was my skin that inflamed him; my hips under the touch of his hands: he would have thought forever about the warmth of my flesh.</s><s>I was forever bound to his throbbing desire.</s><s>One day, at the very same time that I will be speaking in via B., he will be trembling at the memory.</s><s>Oh, I want to change my skin.</s><s>I ran away on my high heels.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Author\\'s translation)</ref> This amazing little piece invites a reflection on the nature of the entanglements between fascist power and its subjects.</s><s>Zavattini might have used \"humor as a weapon,\" but, as the little parable suggests, the dance with power, far from leaving him unscathed, forced him to succumb to its corrupting touch.</s><s>For so many Italians, the moral compromise with fascism involved an often disavowed, yet profound cultural and social debasement, one that remained inscribed on the body, a mark of shame that, as Zavattini so strikingly suggests, can be hardly forgotten or done away with.</s><s>This first conference will have a trial-like title: \"Proceedings against Italian cinema.\"</s><s>Our goal is not simply to survive but to grow thanks to this force that impels us to research our past and which becomes, in its radicality, a guarantee of the future.</s><s>We should not strive to liquidate demagogically the work of twenty years but to individuate what were our individual responsibilities and what legacies are still acceptable.</s><s>(Author\\'s translation) Insistently in those years, Zavattini calls for self-analysis to foster the process of working-through and reconciliation with the past.</s><s>In a short 1946 piece entitled \"The Red Fishes and the Dishonest,\" he declares, \"we will save ourselves if we will know ourselves.\"</s><s>Called to fulfill this arduous task, cinema will at once deflect it and artistically fulfill it.</s><s>Postfascist cinema offered a way to absorb, process, and represent, through a seemingly objective realism, what words could not-the trauma of the war and, more importantly, twenty years of fascism.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>1943-1945: Self-Critique</head></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Poetics as Escape</head><p><s>Zavattini\\'s postwar poetics is marked by this unresolved relation with the past.</s><s>As his art evolved, the call for self-analysis was overshadowed.</s><s>Explaining how the simple fact of meeting the world with a camera could give rise to art, Zavattini wrote in 1953:</s></p><p><s>In the meantime [the filmmaker] should go;

employ, the frameworks within which (and against which) it is conducted.</s><s>They do not take as their horizon the geopolitical hegemony of Ameri? can capitalism but perhaps suggest that this is the direction in which we ought to head.</s><s>Both proceed by taking up, and taking on, one of the supposed paradigms within Irish studies, that of\\'postcolonialism\\' or the \\'colonial model\\', and ask if it represents the emergence of a new form and new object for Irish Studies.</s><s>What John Whyte did for political interpretations of Northern Ireland Stephen Howe undertakes for historical and cultural scholarship of the whole island, pro? ducing a lively polemic and a handy point of reference.</s><s>In place of simplicity he emphasizes the complexity of the relations between Britain and Ireland from their earliest beginnings and the cultural syncretism and forms of hybridity that emerged in this relationship.</s><s>Crucially, he is as attentive to variety and difference within Britain as within Ireland.</s><s>The political manoeuvres played out on Irish soil by British actors were never simply the acts of unified interests from that country (which, in any case, only exist in the minds of paranoid Republicans and the few high Tories still in existence) and were never completely disassociated from internal Irish matters.</s><s>Within these shifting relations, the discourse of colonialism has been reworked and reinvented in response to the perceived needs of the conjuncture.</s></p><p><s>For Howe, the search for an anti-colonial Irish nationalism is in large measure anachronistic: \\'Most Irish nationalists before the 1960s did not use the colonial?</s><s>ism-antic olonialism model in describing their situation.\\'</s><s>He is deeply critical of Republican attempts to claim an anti-colonial context for their struggle, particular?</s><s>ly that version whereby Ireland becomes the first (and last) of all colonies and the training ground both for oppressors and for those who will liberate the world of such oppressions.</s><s>\\'Such notions,\\' he writes, \\'are very 1990s ones, extremely distant from the thought of earlier Irish patriots -as well as exhibiting a mildly megaloma?</s><s>niac evaluation of Irish nationalism\\'s global importance.\\'</s></p><p><s>His argument is clear.</s><s>The colonial model was not central to Irish nationalism or demands for independence until recently, and the history of nationalist thought is often mistreated so as to make it appear more radical and rooted in anti-imperialism than it really was.</s><s>This is not to say that dissent did not exist, nor reason for it, or that there was not an inequitable relationship between parts of Britain and parts of Ireland.</s><s>But when anti-colonial thought was developing within nationalism outside Europe, Irish radicals knew little of it, and assertions that thinkers like Connolly were sophisticated analysts ahead of their time are swiftly rebutted by Howe\\'s mar? shalling of the facts.</s><s>The UK State did not, in any simple sense, conceive of its activity in Ireland as that of a colonial power but rather saw Ireland as part of the multinational UK state.</s><s>When the Irish War of Independence was being fought, the British military were simultaneously using the RAF to bomb Iraqi villages and stem uprising.</s><s>This was not a strategy employed in Ireland at the time.</s><s>That it would have been unthinkable is clearly significant.</s><s>As Howe concludes, \\'State coercion and violence . . .</s><s>were integral to colonial rule everywhere.</s><s>Ireland was not unusual in this . . .</s><s>what stood out was the extent of political integration and cultural assimilation extended to the \"natives\\'\".</s></p><p><s>The underlying target of the book (as in his previous work on Afrocentrism) is cultural nationalism as such.</s><s>With regard to Northern Ireland, he evinces a mea? sured opposition to the \\'two traditions\\' model on the well established (though not widely accepted) grounds that it \\'freezes . . . the perception of there being two fixed, opposed blocs . . .</s><s>with far more internal homogeneity and less permeable borders than is in fact the case\\'.</s><s>He endorses, also tentatively, arguments that urge critical interrogation of such identities and is, therefore, scathing of the postcolonial turn in Irish literary studies (and particularly funny when tilting at Kiberd).</s><s>These studies are built out of an inability or refusal to actually define colonialism and locate it within historical record.</s><s>Postcolonialism, Howe argues, is culturally reduc?</s><s>tionist and too ready to attribute uniformity to the alleged colonizing powers.</s><s>But he is generous enough to admit that postcolonial literary theory has opened up analyses of Ireland to a wider context even if it has done so in a misleading and half-hearted way.</s><s>For while clearly damaging to nationalists, Howe\\'s book is not pro-union.</s><s>In its pleas for a wider and better founded framework within which one can make sense of Ireland, Howe really calls for the assertion of intellectual and scholarly values and some degree of recognition of our bastard selves.</s></p><p><s>He is not entirely opposed to postcolonial or post-structuralist theory which, he acknowledges towards the end in passing, may be \\'genuinely valuable\\' when it \\'posits the necessity for moving on from a \"nationalist\" to an \"emancipatory\" mode . .</s><s>.\\'.</s><s>But part of the problem with post colonial and post-structuralist approaches to Ireland is that often they aren\\'t really either.</s><s>Deconstruction does not advocate the unsettling of binary oppositions in order to replace the essentialism of the domi?</s><s>nant term with an essentialism of the subordinate.</s><s>It attempts to find a way of making visible the strategies by which such discourses make themselves possible (which means exposing that of which a discourse cannot speak but still requires to be spoken within it) in order to clear the space into which we might step if we are to think differently or anew.</s><s>It is in this sense that post-structuralist approaches may have a place in developing a critical cultural and political analysis for Irish studies and from this perspective that Graham and Kirkland offer an approach to the employment of post colonial theory that is other than that of Field Day.</s><s>For them, it is an essential element in a potential redirection of Irish studies but should not be taken to lead automatically to celebration of the nation.</s><s>With this approach, they have a project to bring to fruition.</s><s>This is firstly a theoretical and methodological activity involving \\'a sophisticated and contentious postcolonial analysis of Irish culture\\' emerging out of the introduction of various theorizations (including \\'po-co\\', \\'po-mo\\', \\'de-co\\' and \\'cult-studs\\') and opening up questions of identity and the relationship between place, locality and politics.</s><s>Irish studies as a discrete field of inquiry ought to feel threatened by this.</s><s>The deployment of such theory and method may not be an introduction into, but a sup? planting of, Irish studies.</s><s>Graham and Kirkland want to bring \\'cutting edge\\' cultural theory into Irish studies in order, they say, to destabilize, or at least ques?</s></p><p><s>tion, conceptions of Irishness that treat it as an implicit or explicit unity.</s><s>Hence the subtitle which, in addition to referencing Spivak, suggests an examination of the \\'mechanics\\' by which an authentic Ireland is manufactured.</s><s>This is potentially quite a different form of cultural theory to that taken apart by Howe.</s></p><p><s>In his own contribution to the book, Colin Graham examines the ways in which \\'authenticity\\' achieves an ethical status and the processes by and through which it Irish Cultural Studies to bind together its approaches to cultural events and texts\\'.</s></p><p><s>Kirkland takes on Field Day in a more head-on way, treating the strategies of authors such as Eagleton and Kiberd as just that -strategies that ironize totalizing assumptions as the only way in which to face off\\'oppressive\\' readings ?</s><s>but at the same time (as with Kiberd and Gibbons) developing a teleological notion of hybridity that locates it as the end point of Irish cultural development.</s><s>Thus a theo?</s><s>retical strategy that undermines aggrandizing teleologies (including that which renders Ireland the shining beacon on the path to a hybrid and plural society) becomes employed in their defence.</s><s>On Kirkland\\'s interpretation, the postcolonial framework in Irish studies has functioned to sustain certain sorts of academic criti?</s><s>cal practice, downplaying the epistemological implications of postcolonial thinking and reverting to another totalizing narrative insensitive to contexts.</s><s>\\'Po-co\\' thus takes its place within the framework of the institution of Irish studies rather than enabling the dismantling of those very structures.</s></p><p><s>A bold project then and one potentially less guilty of the charges made by Howe (except for the one of not adequately accounting for the meanings of colonialism in an Irish context).</s><s>But if what you want to do is get away from \\'the part for the whole logic of the use of \"Irish\"\\' then why do Irish studies at all?</s><s>Why not do an Irish studies that did not leave unquestioned the possibility of\\'Irish\\' having a sta?</s></p><p><s>ble referent?</s><s>This is a problem and the collection enacts it.</s><s>It is, after all the programmatic statements, a collection on Ireland and Irishness -and not just on any Ireland.</s><s>A lot of it is concerned with that Ireland, the one that exists in and for Irish studies and consists of novels, poems, the odd play and lots of things that happened in the nineteenth century.</s><s>This is different to the Ireland of the economists (espe?</s><s>cially those economists who live in Frankfurt) or even, in a number of important respects, the Ireland of the sociologists (which is either full of rural crises amongst farming communities or people shopping at the LiffeyValley Centre).</s><s>It is not about the Ireland that goes to see The Matrix and watches Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</s></p><p><s>But it is unfair of a reviewer to complain that a book is not the book he would have produced if he had the time, commitment and knowledge of the real authors.</s></p><p><s>These are very worthwhile essays.</s><s>In the hands of Eamonn Hughes, Tom Paulin becomes a poet trying to see beyond the absolutes of both state and community to the shifting sense of place in which we never quite find ourselves.</s><s>Elsewhere we see \\'cutting edge\\' theory employed to assist new readings, be it Foucault as a way into considering poetic constructions of the body or Gerry Smyth using Judith Butler (with a bit of a heavy hand) to criticize criticism for the role it has played in legiti?</s><s>mating (and thus prescribing) forms of artistic activity that define the nation.</s><s>All this offers many a claim about the sort of\\'subverting\\' and \\'destabilizing\\' of authen?</s><s>tic notions of Irishness without which we would all have to give up critical theory and get jobs in advertising.</s></p><p><s>Elsewhere we do find newer cultural forms put under analysis -television drama (in Lance Pettit\\'s study of an RTE/Thames co-production focusing on the 1921 signing) and even some political essays examining the nature of anti-Irish racism in Britain.</s><s>But there is something of a frustration in reading these essays after reading Howe.</s><s>The strength of Howe is that he draws on a range of scholarship that far exceeds the borders of Ireland.</s><s>He is at his strongest when his book fails to read like a work of Irish studies and feels more like an analysis of colonialism with Ireland as just one case study to be fitted into a complex and differentiated picture (a reversal of the common procedure by which a writer takes some phenomenon or concept and then uses it as a case study to illustrate whatever universal truth about the Irish situation he/she always intended to assert).</s><s>The essays in the Graham/Kirkland book regularly point outside of themselves (to the global practice of media studies whose own canon is insufficiently in evidence here) or to the economics of Adam Smith (usefully drawn on but under-exploited by Clare Connolly in a reading of Castle Rackrent).</s></p><p><s>When Jim Mac Laughlin documents the development of anti-Irish racism in nineteenth-century Britain, he shows how the Irish were racialized not because they were Irish but because of other non-ethnic (mostly economic) factors.</s><s>Bron wen Walter usefully opens up gendered aspects to the racialization of the Irish in Britain but fails to locate this

War I.</s></p><p><s>I shall distinguish three phases in the history of radical nationalism: the modernist, the fascist, and the neo-fascist phases.</s><s>With the term \"fascism,\" I shall refer only to historical Italian fascism.</s><s>I shall use the term \"neo-fascism\" to label those postwar movements that: (a) claim to be the heirs of fascism, (b) assert that the fascist regime was a

terms to avoid the inflation of \"generic fascism.\"</s><s>Fascism was an historical phenomenon.</s><s>To assert the exis?</s><s>tence of \"eternal fascism\" means that we have left the realm of history for the realm of words as ideological idols.</s></p><p><s>The first three decades of this century were the cradle of ideologies and political movements, both of the left and the right, from which stemmed the essentials of Italian political culture.</s><s>This period was the seedbed of most political myths of Italian right-wing radicalism.</s></p><p><s>Radical nationalism was a peculiar motif of the Italian avant-garde, the driving force of the political modernism that accompanied the dynamic of modernization in Italy.</s><s>By political modernism I mean those political ideologies that try to make human beings capable of cluster of myths and beliefs which make up the ideological and cul?</s></p><p><s>tural core of Italian nationalism.</s><s>They assert the primacy of the nation as a spiritual reality and as supreme value in collective life.</s><s>They extol the authority of the national state as an organic community led by an aristocracy of men endowed with spiritual energy.</s><s>These movements, moreover, despise rationalism and criticism and praise the power of myth and faith as spiritual forces uniting the nation and driving it to heroic deeds.</s><s>Before World War I, these movements gave birth to a rad? ical challenge of parliamentary democracy, one in which alternative visions of modernity were aligned in a common front against rational?</s></p><p><s>ist, liberal, and bourgeois modernity.</s><s>In fact, the attitude toward modernity and modernization is one of the main clues in understand?</s><s>ing the permutations of Italian radical nationalism.</s><s>The myth of the new state synthesized the aspirations of young middle-class intellectuals and politicians to create a national state appealing to the masses.</s><s>They wanted to modernize the Italian state by nationalizing the masses and giving Italians a sense of national soli?</s><s>darity by reconciling the classes; they wanted to modernize and indus?</s><s>trialize the country so that it might participate in world politics.</s></p><p><s>The Italian avant-garde movements, such as the groups around Leonardo and La Voce, Futurism, revolutionary syndicalism, and the Nationalist Association, all shared a common note of modernist nationalism, which manifested itself in what I have elsewhere called the \"myth of Italianism,\" a conviction that Italy was destined to have a role as a great protagonist and exercise a civilizing mission.</s><s>These movements believed in the necessity of revolution, a radical process of moral, cultural, and political regeneration.</s><s>Many of the young be?</s><s>Fascism promised to save men and women from the conflicts of modernity&gt; unifying them in a moral community cemented by a political religion.</s></p><p><s>Many supporters of the new state considered that the Italian liberal regime was an antiquated oligarchy, powerless against anti-national forces and unfit to play an active role in national development.</s><s>Parliament and parties were despised as the instruments of a weak and decaying bourgeoisie and of professional politicians.</s><s>The Nationalist Association, developed between 1902 and 1914 and later fused with the Fascist Party, elaborated a genuinely authoritarian par?</s><s>adigm of the new state.</s><s>Liberalism, in its view, was in contradiction with modern life and required new forms of authoritarianism.</s><s>Liberal democracy based on the rational conception of politics, on individual rights, and on compromise aiming to reconcile contrasting interests, was considered out of date in the age of mass society.</s><s>The nationalist Alfredo Rocco, the future architect of the fascist state, already had worked out a radical alternative to the liberal state in order to restrict individual rights and destroy liberalism and socialism.</s></p><p><s>The Great War and its consequences brought about the \"fascist\" to pass through a bloody experience of war and contribute to the cre? ation of a new civilization.</s><s>A positive conception of war in the life of the nation was predominant throughout the new national culture.</s><s>The new Italian was supposed to be shaped through an heroic pedagogy that created a spirit of sacrifice, discipline, readiness for combat, the sublimation of the individual to the national collectivity.</s><s>These ele?</s></p><p><s>ments formed the new national ethics based on the cult of the heroic in an atmosphere of myth and epic, which is still predominant in the con? temporary new radical right.</s></p><p><s>The Great War popularized modernist nationalism among the fight?</s><s>ing masses.</s><s>It created a new collective nationalist mentality by means of the comradeship of the trenches, the exaltation of national solidari?</s><s>ty and discipline, hero worship and the veneration for the fallen, the glorification of leadership and hierarchy based on courage and effi?</s><s>ciency.</s><s>War worked as an element of fusion between right and left wing national radicalism.</s><s>Its most interesting result, in the context of the making of fascism, was the nationalization of some segments of revolutionary syndicalism.</s><s>Since the eve of the war, national syndical?</s><s>ism had become a movement that suggested the ideology of the \"third way,\" beyond right and left, capitalism and socialism.</s><s>The myth of national revolution had a strong anti-conservative meaning for most veterans and young people, who wanted to seize power and reconcile the productive bourgeoisie and the working class in the name of the new Italy.</s></p><p><s>Fascist modernism sought to realize a new synthesis between tradi?</s><s>tion and modernity, without renouncing modernization to realize national power.</s><s>For its part, fascism claimed to have invented a new formula for society capable of saving Western civilization from indus? trialism, mechanism, urbanism, utilitarianism and materialism.</s><s>This formula, however, insisted on the renunciation of individualism and freedom in the name of the primacy of the national collectivity as

of this fascist myth could already be discerned in the fascist party, with its military organization, its style of action, and its terroristic methods, all of which contributed to shape its idea of

fascist state aimed to organize the citizens throughout their life and to mold human nature to its own ends.</s><s>The closely knit network of fascist organizations, from the party to the trade unions, wanted to possess and absorb every aspect of Italian public and private life.</s><s>In this way, fascism promised to save men and women from the conflicts of modernity, unifying them in a moral community cemented by a political religion.</s><s>The sacralization of politics was a peculiar feature of the fascist state.</s><s>By its very nature the totalitarian state had to assume the character of a sacred institution, with rituals and symbols totally enclosing man in his material and moral reality, because only by these means was it possible to involve the individual and the

Italy.</s><s>Today, the only popular expression of a collective national identity is confined to parades celebrating the victories of the Italian soccer team.</s><s>Today the Italians are believed to

and patriotic myth and symbols has been left to neo-fascists, who claim to be the only Italians who hold dear to national tradition, worshipping the nation and putting the interest of the nation-state above all particular interests.</s></p><p><s>Since the end of World War II, radical nationalism has been margin?</s><s>alized.</s><s>It completely lost its influence on the broad masses and on intellectuals.</s><s>Fascist ideology, however, was not totally eradicated.</s></p><p><s>Though the Republican constitution outlawed fascist parties, the MSI originally defined its identity as the heir of historical fascism.</s><s>Most of its leaders have been minor intellectuals or officials of the fascist regime and in the puppet fascist government during the Nazi occupa?</s><s>tion, the Italian Social Republic.</s><s>Its youngest members, who had not directly experienced the fascist period, had been attracted by its zeal?</s><s>ous sense of nationalism, by its idealistic activism, and by the revolu?</s><s>tionary and anti-democratic mythology.</s><s>To establish its ideology, neo fascism drew from fascist tradition, but the predominant motif has long been nostalgia: nostalgia for the lost fascist grandeur, the lost colonial empire, the lost genius of the Duce.</s><s>Neo-fascist identity had been grounded more in emotional than ideological and historical motifs.</s><s>Neo-fascists thought of themselves as true believers of the reli?</s><s>gion of the nation, who had passed through terrible ordeals and were ostracized in a world of turncoats and infidels.</s><s>This self-image still marks the identity of most ultra-right militants and of the MSI.</s></p><p><s>Many essential elements of fascist culture, along with anticommu nism, antiliberalism, antiparliamentarianism, and antiegalitarianism One might just mention the spiritual idea of life, the primacy of myth?</s><s>ical thought, the role of the nation as organic totality, the idea of a strong State, the worshipping of heroic fighting minorities, the myth of revolution as national palyngenesis, the pretension to be a \"third way\" from both capitalism and communism.</s><s>To this core, neo-fascism added, among other things, the belief in the cultural and racial prima?</s></p><p><s>cy of the so-called European nation and the neo-socialist idea of the workers\\' national State intended as the promoter of a partnership between employees and employers.</s></p><p><s>Although the MSTs radical nationalism has never denied its fascist roots, it has not accepted its heritage completely.</s><s>The militia party, the totalitarian State, the new civilization, and the mania for mass organi?</s><s>zations were buried under the rubble of the fascist regime.</s><s>There is another remarkable difference.</s><s>The strengthening of liberal democra?</s><s>cies, the expansion of technology, the mass conformity to fashion and the search for well-being have radically changed the nationalist per? ception of modernity.</s><s>As we have seen, modernist nationalism and fas? cism both perceived modernity as an epoch of expansion dominated by the will to power of young nations run by new elites.</s><s>They also aimed to modernize the country in order to hurl Italy into internation?</s><s>al struggle and to conquer a new empire.</s><s>They did not oppose mass society and technology but wanted to tame and use them for the nation\\'s greatness.</s></p><p><s>Among neo-Fascists, the prevailing attitude towards modernity is a defensive one.</s><s>Neo-Fascists have no enthusiasm for modernity, which they consider to be an epoch of corruption and degeneration dominat?</s><s>ed by mass conformity, materialistic cultures, the machine, egalitari anism, and denationalizing cosmopolitanism.</s><s>Today, after the fall of communism, Americanism has become the main enemy for most neo Fascists, such as the left wing of the MSI led by Pino Rauti, who denounces the moral contagion engendered by the \"American way of life.\"</s><s>They identify modernity with Americanism, that is materialism, hedonism, the cult of wealth, ruthless capitalism, urban neurosis, and dehumanizing technology that transforms human beings into cogs in a machine.</s><s>Right-wing radicalism flees from modernity towards an ideal world remote from mass society and technology.</s><s>Such an ideal world is dreamed up as the mythical tradition of archaic civilization rules by an aristocracy of worriers, the Nordic sagas or the fantasy world of Ronald Tolkien.</s><s>Because the MSI represented all neo-fascist opinions, its politics wavered between conservatism and radicalism, between the tendency to integrate itself into the parliamentary system and the tendency to present itself as the sole radical alternative to the system.</s><s>But in the last decade, the MSI was gradually integrated into the parliamentary sys? tem.</s><s>The participation of the MSI in the parliamentary majority that supported the Berlusconi\\'s government was the climax of this process.</s><s>At the same time, the MSI ceased to be regarded by ultra-right mili?</s><s>tants as the sole heir of fascism.</s><s>Since the seventies, Italian neo-fascism has consisted of a myriad of political, cultural and even terroristic fac? tions, such as New Order and National Vanguard, stemming together from fascist roots or neonazism, often opposing the MSI\\'s politics as too conservative.</s><s>Young right-wing radicals moreover, have been stri?</s><s>dent critics of the MSI\\'s cult of the fascist past.</s><s>This is the case of the New Right, a splinter-group founded in the early eighties opposing the MSI\\'s leader Giorgio Almirante, claiming that it was necessary for right-wing radicalism \"to come out of the fascist tunnel\" and to con? front modern reality.</s><s>They assert, like the French Nouvelle Droit, the primacy of \"metapolitical culture\" instead of political extremism and define themselves as anti-authoritarian, accepting political pluralism and tolerance towards adversaries.</s><s>Their strategy is to conquer con? sent in civil society instead of political power, aiming to build up a new national \"Gemeinschaft\" by stressing the role of sacred values experienced through myths, rites, and festivals while minimizing the State and mass organizations as means to improve national identity.</s><s>They fight against the Americanization of the world and the capitalist consumer society.</s><s>One might characterize this new right as post-mod?</s><s>ern right-wing \"political existentialism\" to distinguish it from the political modernism of fascism.</s><s>On the opposing side of this New Right, there are fringe-groups of rightist extremists identifying them?</s><s>selves as Nazi-skins, whose ideology combines nationalist extremism with the Nazi-inspired idea of racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia.</s></p><p><s>They are criminals devoting themselves to violence against African immigrants and Jews.</s></p><p><s>The MSI hastened to dissociate itself from these extremists, con?</s></p><p><s>demning political violence, antisemitism and xenophobia, but until recently the party had never denied its fascist roots.</s><s>In the 1988 nation?</s></p><p><s>al congress, Fini declared that only fascism was a

Sociale Italiano (MSI).</s><s>And, ini? tially, the programs they espoused were vintage fascism, proclaiming the primacy of the nation over either the individual or any class, the goal of corporatism, the need for Catholicism as the state religion, and the necessity of a foreign policy that reflected a national mission.</s><s>As the MSI alone, and later with its alliance, the Destra Nazionale assumed the mantel of Mussolini, extremism was rejected, at least publicly, and parliamentary democracy was endorsed.</s><s>The party pur? sued legitimacy and a share of political power, but it also tolerated and inspired street violence and welcomed extremists into its ranks.</s><s>The strategy was dubbed the politics of the \"cudgel and the double-breast?</s><s>ed suit,\" but it never succeeded in wooing more than five to six per? cent of the voters.</s><s>That is, until 1994.</s></p><p><s>The parties and the issues that dominated Italian politics since the end of the war are now gone.</s></p><p><s>Politicians and voters alike are adrift.</s><s>The party platform also emphasizes creation of youth associations, the primacy of the family and the woman\\'s role in bearing and rearing children.</s><s>For contemporary consumption, the last leads to opposition to abortion, sterilization, and divorce.</s><s>Though racism is shunned, anti immigrant sentiments are clear in its call for stronger enforcement of immigration laws.</s><s>There are calls for creation of a professional militia with obligatory service for all men and for a European Union that pre? serves national

that follows is why, after fifty years on the political periphery, is there a resurgence now?</s><s>An easy response might be that there is some pathology in the Italian public that renders it susceptible to the call.</s><s>That answer gets me nowhere, since right-wing populist movements are gaining in popularity all across Europe, in Islam, and in the United States.</s><s>Undoubtedly there are some aspects of the cur? rent resurgence that are connected specifically with the Italian experi?</s><s>ence, but others stretch more widely.</s></p><p><s>Looking first at the popularity of the more generic political right, the most obvious phenomenon that has fostered its rise is the end of the Cold War.</s><s>The ideologies that divided the political spectrum into communist and

courage any right-wing regime in Europe.</s><s>Such bilateral agreements, whether tacit or explicit, are now moot.</s><s>There is no more bi-polar world and no longer a postwar agreement.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, most of those who appear attracted by right-wing political movements are people without any experience of fascism or Naziism, since they reached adulthood after the war.</s><s>What had been chilling experiences for people living through them can now be romanticized by ones who did not.</s><s>Fini was, after all, not even born until 1952, and his political

seems, once again, to be getting crowded.</s></p><p><s>There are, of course, some other explanations for the current rise of the right in Italy that are less theoretically lofty, but perhaps more plausible.</s><s>The realignment of political parties in Italy since 1992 has been the result, not of the fall of the Berlin Wall, but of the fallout of Tangentopoli, the massive political corruption scandal that totally dis? credited the dominant Christian Democrats, the Socialists, and the Social Democrats and tainted many of the other primary players.</s><s>The neo-Fascists were unscathed, because they had been excluded from the centers of power, both the government and the sottogoverno, for the whole of the postwar era.</s><s>There is, moreover, a degree of legitimacy that the party has received by its association with Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia Party.</s><s>That, coupled with Fini\\'s masterful use of public relations and his talented theorist Adolfo Urso\\'s ability to tailor a pro? gram with popular appeal, has propelled the party\\'s rise in fortunes.</s><s>The Meaning of Fascism in Italy Today 21 doubt it.</s><s>The resurgence of the neo-or post-Fascists is

dimension; not only did the political \"big events\" take place on their own timetables-in West Germany it took more than a decade for the key events of the late sixties (the most important of which arguably took place in 1967) to be retroactively fitted into the scheme of a world-revolutionary \"1968,\" and in East Germany other caesurae <ref type=\"bibr\">(1953,</ref><ref

could become connected with an emancipatory politics, was decisively affected by local cultural-political conditions.</s><s>In the German Democratic Republic, some of the key caesurae having to do with the possibility of an emancipatory breakout (e.g., <ref type=\"bibr\">1965,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">1971</ref>) relate precisely to the regime\\'s attempts to come to terms with the local reception of global popular culture.</s><s>This makes the problem of \"1968\" in the German Democratic Republic-no less than in the Federal Republic of Germany-a transnational-historical one; for it

There’s a way, oddly enough, that you can be very active in being looked at. Being extremely aware of that. It’s not a position of powerlessness. Women like to look too. PN: The gaze, of flirtation or voyeurism, seems bound up with another major theme of this novel, which is the artificiality of gender. Early on, Grace is warned against promiscuity by her brother: ‘“You did it when you were my age,” she said. “I’m a guy,” he said, “it’s different.” “Fuck difference,” she said’ (H, 37). The novel as a whole seems to ‘fuck difference’ in its play with forms of androgyny, transvestism, and so on. Would that be the right place to put the emphasis? LT: In the sense of a binary division. It’s a very hard thing to discuss. I’m such an anti-essentialist that while I recognize that there is difference, what that means will always be unknown for me. Why hierarchies come into being, how those kinds of differences are arrived at. And while you don’t know, there’s the area you can play. The space in which our ignorance of why things come to be the way they are can also give us the room and energy to fuck around, not to accept things for what they are. PN: The characters are haunted by the seemingly absolute forms of sexual difference then? And the novel seems to gesture toward an opposite idea of gender as fiction. Your references in the novel to Susan Sontag’s essay on Camp reminded me that she had proposed some of these ideas well before Judith Butler and others. Sontag says, for example, that ‘the most refined form of sexual attractiveness…consists in going against the grain of one’s sex’; and she defines Camp as ‘the triumph of the epicene style. (The convertibility of “man” and “woman”, “person” and “thing”).’ How important were these ideas to Haunted Houses? LT: Haunted by difference, yes, and also by the possibility of agency. ‘Camp’ was a revelatory essay for me. Unfortunately Sontag pulled back from those concerns. You would have felt from that essay that in the seventies she could have been a very sophisticated feminist. But she wasn’t, and in fact I think she’s something of an anti-feminist. Those kinds of ideas were important. The first gay male friend I had was when I was eighteen. I thought of feminism and gay liberation as working the same terrain. To me at that point it was all about not accepting what you were being handed on the sexual platter—what roles.

After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi&apos;s policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’. It has been argued that institutional capacity and the dispute resolution mechanism provided in any water sharing agreement determine the extent of cooperation among the member states. Since India and Pakistan are bound by the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, this study tries to assess the effectiveness of this agreement in managing the negative consequences of the climate change.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\\\\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Courts were required to adopt new methods, techniques and devices obtained through advancement of science without affecting the original intention of law. Because of modern technology, a benefit could be taken from said technology to preserve evidences and to assist proceedings of the Court in the dispensation of justice in modern times. Owing to the scientific and technological advancements the admissibility of audio and visual proofs has grown doubtful. No doubt modern evidence assist the court in reaching out to the just decision but at the same time certain criteria need to be laid down which must be satisfied to consider such evidence admissible. Different Case laws are discussed here to show how the cases were resolved on the basis of technological evidence and when and why such evidence have been rejected by the court, if it did. Moreover, legal practices developed in various countries allow our Courts to record evidence through video conferencing. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases statement of juvenile rape victims and other cases of sensitive nature must be recorded through video conferencing to avoid inconvenience for them to come to the Court.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy. The structure of domestic politics is based upon the principles of hostility to India, use of Islam for national unity and strategic alliances with major powers to finance defense against the neighboring countries.

There had been many crematoriums in the city but with the passage of time, one after another, disappeared from the land after partition of the Sub-continent. Those places were replaced by commercial or residential sites. There is also a graveyard in the city which is in the use of Hindu Valmik Sect. However, it was encroached by some Muslims due to very small size of population and indolence of the Hindus. Later on, the encroachments were removed by the District Government Lahore in compliance of order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Presently, there is a graveyard as well as a crematorium in the city.

In this study six growth models have been used for analyzing the main determinants of economic growth in case of cross countries, therefore by using these six models we have tested them for non-nested and nested encompassing through Cox test and F-test respectively. Data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the cross country growth factors so therefore, the current study looked at about forty four countries with modelling these different comparative studies based on growth modelling. So, we can make these six individual models and we can estimate the General Unrestricted Model with the use of econometric technique of Non-Nested Encompassing. By evaluating the data using the Non-Nested Encompassing econometric technique, different sets of economic variables has been used to evaluate which sets of the economic variables are important to boost up the growth level of the country. And found that in case of nested model or full model it is concluded that model with lag value of GDP, trade openness, population, real export, and gross fix capital formation are the main and potential determinants to boost up the Economic Growth in most of the countries.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective. It explains the implications of the findings to continue the language rule as policy experience for teaching in higher education institutions.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities&apos; powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive.

Europe is that of a dependency without the counterpart of integration.</s><s>If it continues for long, one should fear already noticeable reactions of economic nationalism.</s></p><p><s>The collapse of the economic system has accelerated the The case of Slovakia proves, on the contrary, that nationalism is not a rational ideology.</s><s>The Slovaks voted in June 1992 for the nationalist parties,

liberal right wing (Vaclav Klaus) implicitly used the economic argument of the Slovak \"burden\" to induce the Czechs to say \"goodbye\" to a State with which they had identified since 1918.</s><s>Finally, the opposing attitudes of the Czech and Slovak societies with respect to the transition toward market economy (Czech liberalism, Slovak national-populism) helped bring out the

toward separation, The social sciences neither predicted the reawakening of nationalisms, nor saw the coming fall of communism.</s><s>And Robert Solow, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics (a discipline well placed to speak of failure of predictions), asks: \"Why one who predicted so poorly should have relevant opinions on other subjects?\"</s><s>One, therefore, should consider with modesty the contribution of the theoreticians of nationalism.</s><s>The sole (meager) consolation is that the intellectual and political elites have found themselves even more disarmed.</s></p><p><s>Two main interpretations have been proposed for the \"reawakening of nationalisms.\"</s><s>The first, more widespread among the political elites and public opinion, sharing a culturalist or primordialist vision of the nation, sees nothing but archaism, return of history, or return of the repressed.</s></p><p><s>The second, more widespread within the social sciences, considers instead that nationalism and the tardy and disorderly construction of new nation-states on the rubble of the Soviet empire is a stage (not very attractive, to be sure) in the admittance of these societies to the modern world.1</s></p><p><s>The first thesis starts with a reading of post-communist nationalism summarized by the metaphors of the \"refrigerator\" or the \"cauldron.\"</s><s>Communism acted as a freezer, chilling One finds this thesis implicitly in the inaugural speech of President Clinton in January 1993, where he evokes \"a world warmed by the sun of liberty, but menaced by ancestral hatreds.\"</s><s>The same term of \"ancestral hatred\" was used by President Mitterand on the subject of the former Yugoslavia in February 1992 during a colloquy with the provocative title \"Europe and the Tribes.\"</s><s>On one side, Europe, our Europe, marching confidently toward the radiant and supranational future of Maastricht; on the other, the barbarous \"tribes\" of the East, regressing toward the ideologies and behaviors of a bygone age.</s></p><p><s>This interpretation, the most widespread in the West both among the political elites and in the media and public opinion, presents several conveniences.</s><s>First of all, simplicity.</s><s>The nationalism problems of today are merely a reproduction of those of the past.</s><s>Secondly, nationalism involves the \"affective\" dimension of politics.</s><s>If one is dealing with passions or irrational impulses, there is no need to analyze their political nature.</s><s>Finally, it involves \"tribes\" (\"Far away countries of which we know nothing\" said Chamberlain at the time of Munich), which excuses one from making a connection with manifestations of the national life in Western Europe and thus becoming involved.</s><s>For the \"tribes\" of the East do not belong to our history (that of the supranational Europe which is being built) or even to our geography (tribe: cf.</s><s>Third World).</s><s>This interpretation relies on culturalist, historicist, primordialist postulates in the sense that Clifford Geertz defined the \"primordial ties\" of blood (kinship), language, religion or custom, the outcome of \"centuries of progressive crystallization <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">(Geertz, 1963)</ref>.</s><s>Applied to the post-communist realm, it In other words, the question is not whether selfdetermination is good or bad in itself, but whether it is compatible with democracy, an \"open society,\" European integration.</s><s>The argument of size is not decisive either for democracy or for economic viability, despite the statement of the Luxembourgian Minister, Jacques Poos, who explained with unintentional humor at Ljubljana in June 1991 that Slovenia did not have the requisite size to be viable.</s><s>The separation of Norway and Finland from Sweden or of Belgium from the Netherlands in other times, and that of Slovenia or the Baltic countries today, is the consequence and the condition for the development of democracy.</s><s>For the \"small nations,\" according to Michael Walzer or Milan Kundera, independence, or the \"deconstruction\" of the imperial or multinational structures, can be a condition for democracy and European integration.</s><s>This is also the argument developed by the Slovenia philosopher, Valentin Hribar:</s></p><p><s>Only a sovereign nation can sovereignly abandon a portion of its sovereignty and transfer it to the international community. . . .</s><s>Most of the protagonists of the recent nationalist conflicts invoke history.</s><s>Nowhere in the world does one commemorate with such assiduity and pride their historical defeats and their \"St.</s><s>Bartholemew\\'s\" as in post-communist Eastern Europe, the collective memory as an illustration of what D.

rather, it highlights the novel\\'s central tension -the devastating contradictory impulses that Leon feels both towards and against the mem and the representation of his experiences under the Nazis.</s><s>Leon Solom a Holocaust survivor and Jewish historian who, as the novel opens, has be caught stealing pages of texts from the Judaica collection of the New Public Library and surreptitiously selling them to Harvard.</s><s>Disgusted by own lack of caution and afraid that he will be prohibited from practicing life\\'s work as a historian, Leon checks himself into a seedy midtown hote prepares to end his life.</s><s>Over the course of three days, he composes the oir that constitutes the text of this novel.</s></p><p><s>Written in the mid 1980s by an American Jew, The Final Opus of Leon Solomon provides a useful focal point for a discussion of the ethical obligations and the concomitant dangers inherent in historiography and the writing of fiction.</s><s>By writing a novel about a character who writes both \"official\" history and personal memoir, Badanes calls attention to the range of authorial positions from which one might approach the memory and the writing of the Holocaust.</s><s>This novel enters into the ongoing theoretical debates about what Saul Friedlander calls the \"limits\" of Holocaust representationl by actually incorporating them into the text; in other words, Badanes confronts the questions of aesthetic boundaries and the legitimacy of artistic expression by making the act of representation the explicit subject of his work.</s></p><p><s>In the broadest terms, discussions of Holocaust representation revolve around two critical issues: first, the place of the imagination in depicting the horrors of historical reality, and second, the transformation of narrative as traditional systems of thought are called into question.</s><s>Much has been written to suggest that figurative language is simply not appropriate in any discussion of the Holocaust.</s><s>\"There are no metaphors for Auschwitz,\" writes Alvin Rosenfeld in A Double Dying, \"[T]he burnings do not lend themselves to metaphor, simile, or symbol -to likeness or association with anything else.</s></p><p><s>They can only \\'be\\' or \\'mean\\' what they in fact were: the death of the Jews\" (180).</s><s>But while figurative language may be perceived as somehow incompatible with the transmission of factual information, it nevertheless provides \"Surprising the Darkness:\" History, Memory, and 79 Representation in Jerome Badanes\\' The Final Opus of Leon Solomon insight otherwise unavailable.</s><s>There is no way, we come to understand, to represent anything in language without meaning being created -or potentially hidden -by that language.</s></p><p><s>Despite this critical awareness, the debate about the propriety of representation has only intensified during recent years, as Holocaust texts proliferate unabatedly.</s><s>As Geoffrey Hartman suggests in his essay, \"The Book of Destruction,\" \"[previously in civilized society, the limits of representation were linked to social decorum and to the limitations of a particular art medium\"; however, these boundries (if they ever existed) are now being challenged by technological advancements and the capacity \"to provide a mimesis of everything\" (327).</s><s>Such a statement moves the terms of the discussion beyond the immediate relationship between the Holocaust and its figurative representation.</s><s>It also warns against a surfeit of images that, by their very number, distort the unique nature of the Holocaust and, even more significantly, it suggests that contemporary society lacks a certain \"decorum\" toward what for many has become a sacred text.</s><s>The concern that aesthetic choice may overshadow or obscure the event only magnifies the difficulties of representing an experience which bears no resemblance to anything known or imaginable.</s></p><p><s>Currently, the anxieties of Holocaust representation are further compounded by the nihilism so often associated with postmodernism.</s><s>Difficulty distinguishing between the real and the simulated is only one mark of a critical culture that characterizes itself largely through hermeneutic uncertainty.</s></p><p><s>As empiricist methodology is deemed inadequate and the \"master-narratives\" that once organized experience are called into question, representation grows more and more suspect.</s><s>Central to the perceived breakdown of Western philosophical and discursive systems is, for many critics, the argument that posthistoire is by definition post-fascism, post-Auschwitz.</s><s>The Third Reich not only forever transformed the conception of evil, but rendered totalizing narratives difficult to read outside of the context of totalitarianism and genocide.</s></p><p><s>The Final Solution thus serves as a supreme example of the corruption of universalizing principles and stands as an ominous reminder of the dangers of systematized privileged \"truths.\"</s><s>However, the alternative extreme, characterized by absolute fragmentation and an endless provisionally of meaning is, paradoxically, also antithetical to Holocaust representation.</s><s>As a result, writers searching for language or archetypes to help elucidate the experience are caught between two equally untenable aesthetic positions.</s><s>The desire fore realism and the necessity of a belief in human progress and agency is countered by the fear of authoritarian master-narratives.</s><s>One possible resolution, suggests Hartman, is that \"even so estranging an event as the Shoah may have to be estranged again, through art, insofar as its symbols become trite and ritualistic rather than realizing\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Introduction,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">19)</ref>.</s><s>The Final Opus of Leon Solomon, then, \"estranges\" the Holocaust by shifting the \"plot\" of the narrative away from the events of the war and focusing instead on the imaginative and interpretive questions of literary and historical representation.</s><s>The metafictional construction of the novel -or, the author telling the story of a survivor telling the story of himself -serves to foreground issues of representation by self-consciously reflecting upon its position as written text, ultimately displacing attention away from the author and onto a character who is himself a writer.</s><s>Badanes\\' narrator is a survivor and a historian who comes to understand that writing history is a fictional ac that always involves individual interpretation.</s><s>The notion that no chronicl is unmediated, that the genre boundaries between history and fiction are irrevocably blurred, is a devastating realization for Leon Solomon.</s><s>Badanes Representation in Jerome Badanes\\' The Final Opus of Leon Solomon uses this construct to examine the possibility of fulfilling a public obligation to bear witness without being subsumed by personal memories.</s><s>The structure also functions to highlight an ongoing desire to order the world conceptually through language despite an intellectualized awareness of the impossibility of such an act.</s></p><p><s>The metafictional form further provides Badanes with the means to distance himself self-consciously from the position of witness.</s><s>While Leon Solomon is a survivor, Jerome Badanes is not, and like many other writers raised in the aftermath of the Holocaust, he enters the debate about representation from a position outside of the experience that forms the keystone of his character\\'s life.</s><s>Not incidentally, the death camp itself is notably absent from this novel; we see it only once, and then for its moment of shared humanity rather than for its signification of evil.2</s><s>Badanes does not attempt to represent the \"concentrationary universe\"3; instead, this novel confronts the difficulty of survival after liberation.</s><s>Although the period of Nazi rule is still of critical concern, Badanes marks the shift from first-hand experience to second-degree witnessing by choosing to emphasize the position for those years along a larger continuum -in part as a result of the already overwhelming corpus of historical documentation, in part because of his inability to provide \"authentic\" testimony to the actual death camps.</s><s>Rather than placing at its center the miracle of physical survival, this novel\\'s principal concern becomes how to live with the consequences of that survival -most notably, how to be a responsible Jewish historian without succumbing to a disabling despair.</s><s>Leon\\'s position as a historian raises fundamental questions about epistemology and praxis, as testimony of the past merges with testimony of the present in the form of his memoir.</s><s>Significant portions of the past reach his audience through the mediating and interpretive filter of personal memory, while the rest of the narrative is ostensibly the unembellished chronicle of the facts and events of the present.</s><s>But chronicle by virtue of its expression in language is already inflected with narrative meaning, and memory, too, blurs the boundaries between what Hayden White calls the \"content\" of history and narrative emplotment.</s><s>The relationship between text and analyst emerges early in the narrative, when Leon explains \"I have the urge to write this all down, to write it down shamelessly and leave it for another\" (7).</s><s>Having advanced and discarded various strategies of writing \"his-story,\" he now abdicates the responsibility of making meaning to an unidentified other, an audience who haunts him throughout the course of his memoir.</s><s>Asking himself frequently, \"For whom am I writing this document?\"</s><s>he posits \"that ex-student of mine... the university professor\" as one of the more unqualified and unworthy readers, and concludes ultimately that the text -and thereby his legacybelongs rightly to his wife and son <ref type=\"bibr\">(220,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">7)</ref>.</s><s>Charting the tension between the writing of public and personal histories, the novel ultimately determines that they must be joined: as a survivor, Leon Solomon cannot keep them distinct and continue to survive.</s></p><p><s>But the inevitable question becomes even more pronounced: how does one write anything, either personal or public history, let alone the ineffability of the Holocaust?</s><s>Badanes is writing in a world that is simultaneously aware of and resistant to what has often been called the postmodern \"crisis of meaning,\" and this is precisely the epistemological crisis that Leon Solomon finds himself in at the beginning of the novel.</s><s>His memoir begins with an explicit discussion of the arbitrary nature of reality: The coupling of despair and ironic humor in this realization provides a good example of the contradictions and paradoxes that permeate the novel.</s></p><p><s>The implications of such a potentially nihilistic observation are enormous.</s><s>As a historian who has spent his life in the pursuit of narratives that provide an intellectualized, comprehensible ordering of experience, Leon begins the record of his own life with the recognition that wholeness is illusory; that no matter what effort goes into its construction, any system is in the process of deconstructing itself even before it is completed.</s><s>And as a survivor who has made great efforts to interpret and redeem the events of his personal past, the recognition of the impossibility of such a task could lead, quite reasonably, to a sense of hopelessness.</s><s>Yet the memoir that he begins under these circumstances belies a premature attribution of despair; even while making preparations for suicide, Leon Solomon sits down again to write his way into understanding.</s></p><p><s>His self-examination is unwavering and poignant as he weaves together the pieces of his past, as ceaseless in its exploration of the moments of brutality and humiliation as it is in its evocation of images of his childhood in Vilna.</s><s>As the details of his life unfold, we realize that the crisis that has driven him to this Manhattan hotel room is but the culmination of a lifetime of incapacitating memories.</s><s>He tells of his mother\\'s suicide, of living in constant fear of discovery under false identity \"on the Aryan side,\" of forced fellatio with a Jewish prostitute at the hands of two Nazi officers, and, with excruciating clarity, of his sister\\'s torture and death in a public square in Warsaw (124).</s><s>But, in spite of the horror of his wartime experiences, some of the most disturbing moments in the narrative reflect his disease with his American present.</s><s>Leon\\'s disruption of the library collection, his eventual estrangement from his wife and son, and his erotic relationships with both the daughter of a Gestapo officer and an anti-Semitic Black radio host all speak to his absolute inability to escape the psychic consequences of the Nazi regime.</s><s>Profoundly unable to share his wife Inge\\'s \"capacity to live by forgetting,\" Leon\\'s every act is designed to ensure his position of precariousness and alienation from the world (205).</s></p><p><s>For Leon Solomon, the real trouble, paradoxically, can be said to begin after the fact, with the difficulty of reconciling the present to the memories of the past.</s><s>This post-war tension is clearly marked in the transformation of his philosophy of historiography.</s><s>Leon\\'s work as a historian begins with the exigency of salvaging, at any cost, any remnants of Jewish lives lost to the Nazis.</s><s>He makes clear the crucial function of his profession, as well as its relationship to the Jewish community, when he says, \"It is the supreme irony of my life that my incarceration in Auschwitz saved me, first by putting me back with other Jews, and second, by reawakening in me my sense of purpose as a historian\" (133).</s><s>Having lived in isolation in Warsaw as a Catholic with forged identity papers, unable to continue his work with the Jewish resistance out of fear of discovery, the fellowship of the death camp provided a new mission: \"to keep alive in me the beings of others\" (16).</s><s>He goes on to explain:</s></p><p><s>We were all the keepers of each other\\'s beings -and I knew that the others knew that -yet we were all disappearing.</s><s>Or becoming blind.</s><s>Representation in Jerome Badanes\\' The Final Opus of Leon Solomon Who then, I would ask myself, would be left to rescue all these beings, each one of which was filled with many other beings from his earlier life, from his parents\\' and grandparents\\' lives, which he was carrying inside himself?</s><s>My strength derived from my obligation as an historian...</s><s>I would write a commentary, I daydreamed, a memorial <ref type=\"bibr\">(16)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Acting as an excavator of historical persons and events is an act of defiance in the context of the camps, providing Leon not only with a sense of ordering -or mastering -the current experience, but also according him a future in which he imagines himself participating in a grand historical enterprise.</s><s>His sense of obligation as a historian grounds him within both a secular and a Jewish historical tradition, reflecting his acceptance of an authority decreed by his presence at the events that he records as well as of the Jewish commandment to bear witness.4</s><s>In the years after the war he talks about himself as \"the archivist and savior\" of the \"precious volumes\" that constitute Jewish history, seeing himself as their guardian as well as their interpreter (13).5</s><s>It is still possible, at this early stage of his career, for Leon to believe that he can provide a service to both the Jewish community and to the world by recording history \"as it was,\" conveying reality directly and mimetically into representation.</s></p><p><s>But the capacity to remember serves a personally redemptive function in the camps as well as a public one;

Savinov. Philosophy of Antiquity in Scholasticism This article examines the forms of understanding ancient philosophy in medieval and post-medieval scholasticism. Using the comparative method the author identifies the main approaches to the philosophical heritage of Antiquity, and to the problem of reviving the doctrines of the past. The Patristics (Epiphanius of Cyprus, Filastrius of Brixia, Lactantius, Augustine) saw the ancient cosmological doctrines as heresies. The early Middle Ages (e.g., Isidore of Seville) assimilated the content of these heresiographic treatises, which became the main source of information about ancient philosophy. Scholasticism of the 13th–14th cent. remained cautious to ancient philosophy and distinguished, on the one hand, the doctrinal content discussed in the framework of the exegetic problems at universities (Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, etc.), and, on the other hand, information on ancient philosophers integrated into chronological models of medieval chronicles (Peter Comestor, Vincent de Beauvais, Walter Burleigh). Finally, the post-medieval scholasticism (Pedro Fonseca, Conimbricenses, Th. Stanley, and others) raised the questions of the «history of ideas», thereby laying the foundation of the history of philosophy in its modern sense.

The Chronology of Democritus and the Fall of Troy The article considers the chronology of Democritus of Abdera. In the times of Classical Antiquity, three different birth dates for Democritus were known: c. 495 BC (according to Diodorus of Sicily), c. 470 BC (according to Thrasyllus), and c. 460 BC (according to Apollodorus of Athens). These dates must be coordinated with the most valuable doxographic evidence, according to which Democritus 1) &quot;was a young man during Anaxagoras’s old age&quot; and that 2) the Lesser World-System (Diakosmos) was compiled 730 years after the Fall of Troy. The article considers the argument in favor of the most authoritative datings belonging to Apollodorus and Thrasyllus, and draws special attention to the meaning of the dating of Democritus’ work by himself from the year of the Fall of Troy. The question arises, what prompted Democritus to talk about the date of the Fall of Troy and how he could calculate it. The article expresses the opinion that Democritus indicated the date of the Fall of Troy not with the aim of proposing its own date, different from others, but in order to date the Lesser World-System in the spirit of intellectual achievements of his time, in which, perhaps, the history of the development of mankind from the primitive state to the emergence of civilization was discussed. The article discusses how to explain the number 730 and argues that it can be the result of combinations of numbers 20 (the number of generations that lived from the Fall of Troy to Democritus), 35 – one of the constants used for calculations of generations in genealogical research, and 30. The last figure perhaps indicates the age of Democritus himself, when he wrote the Lesser Diakosmos: 30 years old.

Concerning the authorship of this text, the Indian and Chinese traditions diverge: in the first, the treatise is attributed to Asanga, and in the second tradition to Maitreya. Most of the modern scholars consider it to be a compilation of many texts, and not the work of one author. Being an important monument for both the Yogacara tradition and Mahayana Buddhism in general, Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra is an object of scientific interest for the researchers all around the world. The text of the treatise consists of five parts, which are divided into chapters. The contents of the treatise sheds light on many concepts of Yogācāra, such as ālayavijñāna, trisvabhāva, kliṣṭamanas, etc. Having briefly considered the textological problems: authorship, dating, translation, commenting and genre of the text, the author suggests the reconstruction of the content of the entire monument, made on the basis of his own translation from the Tibetan and Sanskrit. This allows him to single out from the whole variety of topics those topics, the study of which will increase knowledge about the history of the formation of the basic philosophical concepts of Yogācāra and thereby allow a deeper understanding of the historical and philosophical process in Buddhism and in other philosophical movements of India.

The author analyzes the formation of the theory of knowledge in the Arab-Muslim philosophy. At the early stages of the formation of the Arab-Muslim philosophy the discussion of the question of cognition was conducted in the framework of ethical and religious disputes. Later followers of the Falsafa introduced the legacy of ancient philosophers into scientific circulation and began to discuss the problems of cognition in a philosophical way. Nāșir Khusraw, an Ismaili philosopher of the 11th century, expanded the scope of knowledge and revised the goals and objectives of the process of cognition. He put knowledge in the foundation of the world order, made it the cause and ultimate goal of the creation of the world. In his philosophy knowledge is the link between the different levels of the universe. The article analyzes the Nāșir Khusraw’s views on the role of knowledge in various fields – metaphysics, cosmogony, ethics and eschatology. Keywords: knowledge, cognition, Ismailism, Nāșir Khusraw, Neoplatonism, Arab-Muslim philosophy, kalām, falsafa DOI: 10.21146/2074-5869-2018-23-2-44-55 Vera Pozzi. Problems of Ontology and Criticism of the Kantian Formalism in Irodion Vetrinskii’s “Institutiones Metaphysicae” (Part II) This paper is a follow-up of the paper «Irodion Vetrinskii’s “Institutiones Metaphysicae” and the St. Petersburg Theological Academy» (Part I). The issue and the role of “ontology” in Vetrinskii’s textbook is analyzed in detail, as well as the author’s critique of Kantian “formalism”: in this connection, the paper provides a description of Vetrinskii’s discussion about Kantian theory of the a priori forms of sensible intuition and understanding. To sum up, Vetrinskii was well acquainted not only with Kantian works – and he was able to fully evaluate their innovative significance – but also with late Scholastic textbooks of the German area. Moreover, he relied on the latters to build up an eclectic defense of traditional Metaphysics, avoiding at the same time to refuse Kantian perspective in the sake of mere reaffirming a “traditional” perspective. Keywords: Philosophizing at Russian Theological Academies, Russian Enlightenment, Russian early Kantianism, St. Petersburg Theological Academy, history of Russian philosophy, history of metaphysics, G.I.

Criticism of Judaism in Hegel&apos;s Early “Theological” Writings The aim of the article is to reveal the nature of criticism of Judaism by the “young” Hegel and underlying intuitions. The investigation is based on the phenomenological approach. It seeks to explicate the horizon of early Hegel&apos;s thinking. The revolutionary role of early Hegel’s ideas reactivation in the history of philosophy is revealed. The article demonstrates the fundamental importance of criticism of Judaism for the development of Hegel&apos;s thought. The sources of Hegelian thematization and problematization of Judaism – his Protestant theological background within the framework of supranaturalism and the then discussion about human rights and political emancipation of Jews – are discovered. Hegel&apos;s interpretation of the history of the Jewish people and the origin of Judaism from the destruction of trust in nature, the fundamental mood of distrust and fear of the world, leading to the development of alienation, is revealed. The falsity of the widespread thesis about early Hegel’s anti-Semitism is demonstrated. The reasons for the transition of early Hegel from “theology” to philosophy are revealed. Keywords: Hegel, Judaism, history, criticism, anti-Semitism, trust, nature, alienation, tyranny, philosophy DOI: 10.21146/2074-5869-2018-23-2-68-80 Evgeniya A. Dolgova. Philosophy at the Institute of Red Professors (1921–1938): Institutional Forms, Methods of Teaching, Students, Lecturers The article explores the history of the Institute of the Red Professors in philosophy (1921–1938). Referring to the unpublished documents in the State Archives of the Russian Federation and the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the author explores its financial and infrastructure support, information sphere, characterizes students and teachers. The article illustrates the practical experience of the functioning of philosophy within the framework of one of the extraordinary “revolutionary” projects on the renewal of the scientific and pedagogical sphere, reflects a vivid and ambiguous picture of the work of the educational institution in the 1920s and 1930s and corrects some of historiographical judgments (about the politically and socially homogeneous composition of the Institute of Red Professors, the specifics of state support of its work, privileges and the social status of the “red professors”).

Starovoitov. K. Horney about the Consequences of Neurotic Development and the Ways of Its Overcoming This article investigates the views of Karen Horney on psychoanalysis and neurotic development of personality in her last two books: “Our Inner Conflicts” (1945) and “Neurosis and Human Grows” (1950), and also in her two articles “On Feeling Abused” (1951) and “The Paucity of Inner Experiences” (1952), written in the last two years of her life and summarizing her views on clinical and theoretical problems in her work with neurotics. If in her first book “The Neurotic Personality of Our Time” (1937) neurosis was a result of disturbed interpersonal relations, caused by conditions of culture, then the concept of the idealized Self open the gates to the intrapsychic life.

A Historical and Philosophical Reconstruction of Dignāga’s Pramāṇasamuccayavṛtti (1.13-16) The paper investigates a fragment from Dignāga’s magnum opus Pramāṇasamuccayavṛtti (“Body of tools for reliable knowledge with a commentary”, 1, 13-16) where Dignāga challenges Vasubandhu’s definition of perception in the Vādaviddhi (“Rules of the dispute”). The definition from the Vādaviddhi is being compared in the paper with Vasubandhu’s ideas of perception in Abhidharmakośabhāṣya (“Encyclopedia of Abhidharma with the commentary”), and with Dignāga’s own definition of valid perception in the first part of his Pramāṇasamuccayavṛtti as well as in his Ālambanaparīkśavṛtti (“Investigation of the Object with the commentary”). The author puts forward the hypothesis that Dignāga criticizes the definition of perception in Vādaviddhi for the reason that it does not correspond to the teachings of Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, to which he, Dignāga, referred earlier in his magnum opus. This helps Dignāga to justify his statement that Vasubandhu himself considered Vādaviddhi as not containing the essence of his teaching (asāra). In addition, the article reconstructs the logical sequence in Dignāga’s exegesis: he criticizes the Vādaviddhi definition from the representational standpoint of Sautrāntika school, by showing that it does not fulfill the function prescribed by Indian logic to definition, that of distinguishing perception from the classes of heterogeneous and homogeneous phenomena. Having proved the impossibility of moving further according to the “realistic logic” based on recognizing the existence of an external object, Dignāga interprets the Vādaviddhi’s definition in terms of linguistic philosophy, according to which the language refers not to external objects and not to the unique and private sensory experience (svalakṣaṇa-qualia), but to the general characteristics (sāmānya-lakṣaṇa), which are mental constructs (kalpanā).

Tolstoy: Reception of the Writer&apos;s Views in the Public Thought of Russia at the End of the 19th Century (Dedicated to the 190th Anniversary of the Great Russian Writer and Thinker) This article includes previously unpublished letters of Russian social thinkers such as N.N. Strakhov, E.M. Feoktistov, D.N. Tsertelev. These letters provide critical assessment of Lev N. Tolstoy’s teachings. The preface to publication includes the history of reception of Tolstoy’s moral and aesthetic philosophy by his contemporaries, as well as influence of his theory on the beliefs of Russian idealist philosopher D.N. Tsertelev. The author offers a rational reconstruction of the dialogue between two generations of thinkers representative of the 19th century – Lev N. Tolstoy and N.N. Strakhov, on the one hand, and D.N. Tsertelev, on the other. The main thesis of the paper: the “old” and the “new” generations of the 19th-century thinkers retained mutual interest and continuity in setting the problems and objectives of philosophy, despite the numerous worldview contradictions. Keywords: Russian philosophy of the nineteenth century, L.N. Tolstoy, N.N. Strakhov, D.N.

Vorlesungen zur Ästhetik. Vorlesungsmitschrift Adolf Heimann (1828/1829). Hrsg. von A.P. Olivier und A. Gethmann-Siefert. München: Wilhelm Fink, 2017. XXXI + 254 S.) Released last year, the book “G.W.F. Hegel. Vorlesungen zur Ästhetik. Vorlesungsmitschrift Adolf Heimann (1828/1829)” in German is a publication of one of the student&apos;s manuskript of Hegel&apos;s lectures on aesthetics. Adolf Heimann was a student of Hegel in 1828/29. These notes open for us imaginary doors into the audience of the Berlin University, where Hegel read his fourth and final course on the philosophy of art. A distinctive feature of this course is a new structure of lectures in comparison with three previous courses. This three-part division was took by H.G. Hotho as the basis for the edited by him text “Lectures on Aesthetics”, included in the first collection of Hegel’s works. The content of that publication was mainly based on the lectures of 1823 and 1826. There are a number of differences between the analyzed published manuskript and the students&apos; records of 1820/21, 1823 and 1826, as well as between the manuskript and the editorial version of H.G. Hotho. These features show that Hegel throughout all four series of Berlin lectures on the philosophy of art actively developed and revised the structure and content of aesthetics. But unfortunately this evidence of the permanent development was not taken into account by the first editor of Hegel&apos;s lectures on aesthetics. Keywords: G.W.F. Hegel, H.G.

Coreth Readers are invited to review the monograph of the modern German researcher Oksana Nazarova “The problem of the renaissance and new foundation of metaphysics through the example of Christian philosophical tradition. Russian religious philosophy (Simon L. Frank) and German neosholastics (Emerich Coreth)”, which was published in 2017 in Munich. In the paper, the author offers a comparative analysis of the projects of a new, “post-dogmatic” metaphysics, which were developed in the philosophy of Frank and Coreth. This study addresses the problems of the cognitive-theoretical and ontological foundation of the renaissance of metaphysics, the methodological tools of the new metaphysics, as well as its anthropological component. O. Nazarova&apos;s book is based on the comparative analysis of Frank&apos;s religious philosophy and Coreth&apos;s neo-cholastic philosophy from the beginning to the end. This makes the study unique in its own way. Since earlier in the German reception of the heritage of Russian thinker, the comparison of Frank&apos;s philosophy with the Catholic theology of the 20th century was realized only fragmentarily and did not act as a fundamental one. Along with a deep and meaningful analysis of the metaphysical projects of both thinkers, this makes O. Nazarova&apos;s book relevant to anyone who is interested in the philosophical dialogue of Russia and Western Europe and is engaged in the work of Frank and Coreth.

law, the testimony of Blackshirts revealing much about their attempted selfpresentation and their attitudes to violence.</s><s>For instance, Mosley and another fiftyfive witnesses were called to answer summonses alleging riotous assembly following a fascist meeting at Worthing that took place on 9 October 1934.</s><s>Mosley used these court appearances as opportunities to vindicate his position and to play down, as much as possible, the Blackshirt reputation for offensive violence.</s><s>\\'Sir Oswald felt it was essential for his own honour, both as a man and as a leader of the

asked:</s></p><p><s>\\'Has your organization at your meetings to your knowledge, ever attacked a member of the public unless the public attacked them first?\\',</s><s>Mosley responded, \\'No, our

policy of the movement shifted and the BU refashioned itself, from 1938 onwards, into an anti-war movement.</s><s>The British New Fascist Man was not a static figure, and one can discern important shifts over time in the construction of the fascist body.</s><s>An interesting transformation in the movement s imaginative landscape can be discerned by the closing years of the 1930s.</s><s>In its early years its response to pacifism was predictable, as the following example illustrates:</s></p><p><s>The pacifist resolution recently passed after a debate in the Oxford Union declaring that the House would in no circumstances fight for King and country, roused a storm of controversy, but only the Fascists were virile enough to take direct action.</s><s>While the Conservatives were busy writing letters of protest and uttering vague threats, the Fascists marched into the Union and removed the offending minutes from the book.79</s></p><p><s>From this we can see that the BUF was anything but pacifist from the outset, and committed assault on pacifists.</s></p><p><s>However, when the BU recast itself as an anti-war movement, male body imagery was likewise re-imagined and again dismembered in order to substantiate the rejection of war.</s><s>Confluent with the shift from an aesthetic of whole and healthy bodies to one of dismembered and deformed ones was the recognition that Mosley \\'s movement was itself in its dying days, putrefied and corpse-like.</s><s>On defecting from the BU, A. K. Chesterton wrote: \\'I might have continued trying to galvanize the unhappy corpse into a semblance of life had I not come to the conclusion that it was not so much any coterie that stood in the way of revolutionary advance as blind spots in  That being said, there is still ample evidence to suggest that there were deepening schisms among the membership on this as on many other ideologically and emotionally divisive issues.</s><s>The transition from a paramilitary hyper-masculinity that characterises body fascism at its peak of bravado during the first years of BUF activity was also spurred on by the looming war, occasioning an intensification of military values.</s><s>The turn to an oxymoronic fascist pacifism, accompanied by a more doom-laden body politics, was not one that was followed by all members of the dwindling organisation.</s><s>Thus in January 1938 one fascist wrote:</s></p><p><s>Equally alarming is the spiritual emasculation of our race.</s><s>Here is a tragic example of dithering effeminacy which threatens British manhood.</s><s>It seems that a gentle flower joined the Army and did not like its rough and ready ways, so when its time was up it wrote a book condemning the great brute.</s><s>\\'Why did men desert?\\' it exclaims, and supplies the answer: \\'For a number of reasons.</s><s>than any other charge would be that of shirker or deserter, the notional diminished masculinity of a conscientious objector or a pacifist always incongruous with fascist core principles and ideals.84</s></p><p><s>The \\'body fascism\\' of the 1930s, shared many meanings with how we use the term today, namely by prioritising body over mind, if not sacrificing intellect to the more primitive instincts of the body, and especially massed bodies.</s><s>The BUF was more about style than substance, and not merely because it was a marginal movement that failed to achieve electoral success, dismantle the democratic system, and put in its place the Corporate -corporeal -state.</s><s>Only by taking a cultural approach to political history can we see that in its development of political technology, its reliance on the uniform, its aestheticised brutality, its representations of the supremely virile Leader, and its attempt to appropriate fashion for fascism, the BUF was clearly a product of modernity and one potent, if disturbing, expression of the convergence between populist politics and trend-obsessed consumer culture.</s><s>However, it is important not to be numb to the \\'fascist\\' charge of this \\'body fascism\\', or to sacrifice political meaning to surface appearance, voyeuristic appeal, and sensational spectacle, or to demote the political threat posed by the movement.</s><s>After all, the Blackshirt body was not only intended to be attractive and infuse sex appeal into a hubristic movement.</s><s>The fascist body was also constructed as an offensive weapon, as a cog in the paramilitary wheel, and in their collective formations fascist bodies were mobilised to reap havoc on the British body politic, and especially to mount a frontal attack on all those vulnerable bodies they stigmatised as \\'other\\' and inferior.</s><s>Acting alone, the Blackshirt body had little power, but acting in concert, Blackshirts became a \\'pack of human wolves\\'85 -something less than human -as A. J. Cummings described fascist stewards at the violent Olympia meeting.</s><s>By historicising the concept of \\'body fascism\\' we should be able to shed the ambivalence with which we read and react to the term in its current usage.</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" xml:id=\"fig_0\"><head>7</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>For a comprehensive discussion of the political fate and legacy of British fascism, see Mick Cronin, ed., The Failure of Fascism in Britain: The Far-right and the Fight for Political Recognition (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1996).</s><s>8 See Julie Gottlieb and Thomas Linehan, eds., The Culture of Fascism: Visions of the Far Right in Britain (London: I.

de los procesos en marcha y, como el resto de los italianos, habian asumido con relation al fascismo una amplia gama de posiciones que iban desde la adhesion militante a la oposicion activa de una

entusiasmo el fascismo hasta la entrada en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la dramatica realidad de los bombardeos de las ciudades, el racionamiento de los alimentos, la evacuation y la muerte produjeron un fenomeno de gradual pero inexorable desgaste del consenso23.</s><s>En algunos ambientes catolicos, particularmente entre los intelectuales, la promulgation de las leyes raciales y luego la guerra

pedagogia de la memoria, con la finalidad de comprender que habia sido el fascismo y cuales las razones por las que tantos italianos honestos y de buena fe habian sostenido un regimen liberticida y belicista.</s><s>Despues del 8 de septiembre de ese ano, el discurso sobre el fascismo cambio de manera significativa.</s><s>El renacido neofascismo en el Norte, aparte de representar una amenaza grave para el restablecimiento de la democracia, demostro que el fascismo no habia sido de ningun modo liquidado y que una parte de los italianos continuaba luchando y muriendo en su nombre.</s><s>La prioridad de concentrar el fuego de la propaganda contra un enemigo todavia vivo y las dificiles condiciones en que trabajaba la prensa, reducida a la clandestinidad salvo en los territorios liberados por las tropas aliadas, condujeron a una drastica limitacion, aunque no a una completa desaparicion, del debate sobre el fascismo.</s><s>Si, por un lado, la demonizacion de los neofascistas, de quienes perseveraban en el error de combatir por la causa equivocada, prevalecia en esa timida indagacion sobre las causas y las Ya el dia despues de la caida del fascismo emergia del analisis de algunos intelectuales una imagen de la sociedad italiana completamente distinta de la presentada por la prensa de los partidos antifascistas, que en su mayoria tendia a interpretar las manifestaciones de alegria con las cuales habia sido acogida la noticia de la destitution de Mussolini en algunas ciudades italianas como la prueba de una tenaz aversion al fascismo incubada desde siempre por las

del mismo frente antifascista, un discurso que ponia el acento en la vasta obra de corruption de las conciencias llevada a cabo por la persuasiva maquina organizativa y propagandistica del regimen, subrayando el consiguiente peligro que suponia la supervivencia de una difusa «mentalidad fascista» para el nuevo Estado democratico.</s><s>Que prevaleciera una representacion desresponsabilizadora y edulcorada del pasado no fue fruto del antiguo vicio «chaquetero» de los italianos, sino de la aplicacion de una «politica del pasado» ampliamente condicionada por las expectativas colectivas y conscien- temente adoptada por las principales fuerzas politicas que, de manera semejante a lo sucedido en Alemania, condenaban por un lado la ideologia fascista, mientras por el otro reintegraba a la vida publica a la mayoria de quienes habian creido en el fascismo57.</s></p><p><s>Un ejemplo de dificil transicion al posfascismo: los intelectuales de la «generacion del littorio» Los antifascistas tenian buenas razones para creer que la mayor parte de los italianos encontraria en breve plazo una colocacion politica dentro del nuevo sistema, pero la cuestion de la llamada «generacion del littorio» o de Mussolini, es decir, los jovenes nacidos y crecidos en el seno del regimen fascista, no podia ser afrontada con el mismo optimismo.</s><s>Las nuevas generaciones habian sido criadas desde la infancia en las organizaciones del partido fascista, que habia dispuesto un complejo programa educativo destinado a seguir al joven en cada momento de su vida.</s><s>Esta obra de formacion, que tenia como objetivo la creation de un «hombre nuevo», habia sido especialmente eficaz con los jovenes pertenecientes a las clases medias, entre quienes el regimen habia seleccionado una nueva elite intelectual de autenticos militantes en la fe fascista cuya tarea era propagar esa fe y sus mitos entre las masas58.</s><s>El que hacer con estos jovenes animo un prolongado debate en la prensa.</s></p><p><s>En todos los analisis de los observadores contemporaneos, desde los comunistas a los liberales, quedo claro que el fascismo habia conseguido crear una profunda fractura cultural entre las generaciones.</s><s>Los jovenes entre veinte y cuarenta anos ignoraban completamente el patrimonio de valores politicos y civiles de la Italia antifascista y por eso no parecian los mas aptos para participar en el esfuerzo colectivo para la reconstruction del pais.</s><s>El 10 de septiembre de 1943, el lider de la Democracia Cristiana y futuro presidente del gobierno, Alcide De

central de su reeduca-cion59.</s><s>Hasta Croce, quien sostenia en sus intervenciones publicas que el fascismo no habia dejado huellas profundas en la sociedad, hacia mediados de 1944 reconocio la dramatica condition de postracion moral en la que se hallaba la que definia como una «generacion desventurada»60.</s><s>Reinsertar a estos jovenes en la nueva vida democratica exigia poner remedio a

dominio fascista consistia precisamente en haber dejado como herencia a la democracia una juventud postrada y sin rumbo, inmadura para participar en la vida publica.</s><s>A la generation mas anciana, la que se habia opuesto al fascismo, se le encomendaba por tanto la obra de «reeducacion de la juventud» y, al mismo tiempo, la de dirigir la reconstruction material y politica, rompiendo asi una

la Democracia Cristiana (DC) en la Asamblea Constituyente elegida en 1946, todavia a mediados de 1944 distinguia entre un «antifascismo formal y vacio» y el «posfascismo», entendido «como fenomeno capaz de entender y, verdadera y sustancialmente, de superar su termino opuesto»74.</s></p><p><s>Este tema de la aspiracion a una regeneracion moral de la politica opuesta a lo que se juzgaba como vil oportunismo y ansias de poder del antifascismo aparece en la reflexion de muchos jovenes intelectuales crecidos en el fascismo.</s><s>Un grupo reunido en torno a la revista milanesa Costume veia la causa del extravio de los jovenes en que estos se encontraban frente a una politica que, falta de cualquier aspiracion ideal, les parecia envilecida y reducida a una mera capacidad tecnica.</s><s>En las paginas de Costume , la llamada a Luca La Rovere Los intelectuales italianos y la transition al posfastismo la dimension etica y espiritual de la politica era utilizada para deslegitimar a la clase politica, considerada poco apta para volver a levantar al pais, contraponiendo a la retorica, al arrivismo y a la insensibilidad psicologica de las clases dirigentes una superior conception politica de los jovenes75.</s><s>La confianza en las posibilidades de reconducir las energias nacionales hacia una formula que no fuera ni fascista ni antifascista no se tradujo, sin embargo, en un proyecto articulado y creible.</s><s>En realidad, se trataba de una position puramente negativa que contestaba el valor del antifascismo como ideologia, como canon de interpretation de la reciente historia nacional y como base programatica de la reconstruccion identitaria y material de la nation, y negaba desde la raiz la legitimidad de aquel proyecto pedagogico considerado necesario por gran parte de los antifascistas para refundar una nueva conciencia democratica de los italianos.</s></p><p><s>Esta posicion, pese al comun rechazo del antifascismo, no era asimilable al neofascismo, en cuanto partia del presupuesto de que el fracaso del fascismo era un hecho irrefutable.</s><s>Mas bien suponia la senal de un malestar de los jovenes hacia la realidad politica de la posguerra, aunque dentro de el confluian trayectorias politicoculturales y existenciales muy diversas, desde quienes habian tornado pronto las armas contra el fascismo a quienes lo habian abandonado tarde y por fuerza de las circunstancias.</s><s>Se trataba de un vago estado de animo, pero no por ello dejaba de tener un efecto muy concreto: el de poner a un sector relevante de la juventud italiana en una especie de limbo, en una posicion en la cual el alejamiento del fascismo no resultaba suficiente para superar la desconfianza hacia el antifascismo y para aceptar en todos sus terminos el sistema politico en vias de realizacion.</s></p><p><s>Por su parte, los antifascistas no dejaron de remarcar que esta posicion, que hacia compatible el repudio del «mito fascista» con el rechazo a asumir los «propositos de reconstruccion antifascista», suponia de hecho un «residuo de mentalidad fascista»: «mentre esteriormente appare la espressione sincera di un desiderio di miglioramento e di naturale repulsa per i ritorni immutati all\\'antefascismo, 75 Parlato, G.: «Dalla moralita del combattimento al moralismo della politica.</s><s>I giovani liberali di \"Costume\" e la delusione dell <ref type=\"bibr\">\\'

una estrategia discursiva que insistia en el trabajoso pero irreversible proceso de emancipation de los jovenes de los mitos fascistas.</s><s>En particular, el Partido Comunista desarro-116, a traves de sus medios de prensa, una verdadera estrategia de la memoria para la juventud.</s><s>Los intelectuales comunistas, a menudo jovenes que provenian del fascismo, fueron los encargados de construir una memoria publica de la experiencia fascista que pusiera remedio a esa crisis generacional y, al mismo tiempo, que favoreciera el ingreso de los jovenes exfascistas en el partido.</s><s>Como argumentaba en 1946 el intelectual y escritor Elio Vittorini, exfascista convertido al comunismo y autor de una de las mas famosas novelas sobre la Resistencia77, los jovenes habian dado su adhesion al fascismo sobre la base de sus esloganes revolucionarios y anticapitalistas, sin comprender que aquel era solo un instrumento de la reaccion y del capital.</s><s>Por ese motivo, el suyo era un modo «antifascista de ser fascistas».</s><s>La conclusion era que los jovenes que habian creido en las promesas de justicia social del regimen tenian la posibilidad ahora de realizarlas militando en el Partido Comu-nista78.</s><s>Este genero de narracion sera divulgado con extraordinario exito -hasta el punto de ser asumido por la historiografia -gracias al libro II lungo viaggio attraverso il fascismo , del exfascista y militante comunista Ruggero Zangrandi, donde se describia el dificil itinerario de un joven nacido y crecido en el regimen para encontrar el camino del antifascismo79.</s></p><p><s>76 «Mientras exteriormente parece la expresion sincera de un deseo de mejora y de natural repulsa a un regreso al estado de cosas anterior al fascismo, es en verdad, hay que decirlo, una inconsciente adhesion a la predicacion del fascismo, una reliquia de la danosa costumbre de tener a quien pensaba siempre por todos, manteniendolos bajo su tutela paternalista»; en «Retaggio fascista», L\\'Azione, 10 de no- niendo una actitud verbal de desconfianza hacia los jovenes influidos por el fascismo, no dudo en tomar contacto con los excombatientes de la Republica Social Italiana81, mientras que autorizados representantes del Partido Liberal y del Partido Republicano llegaron a defender que el antifascismo de los mas jovenes podia considerate mas puro y genuino que el de los mayores porque habia sido conquistado a traves de un duro aprendizaje de la conciencia y en condiciones de extrema soledad82.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>El debate sobre las herencias del fascismo muestra de manera evidente los limites del paradigma antifascista, segun el cual los italianos habrian permanecido inmunes a la influencia fascista y eso les habria permitido desembarazarse del pasado sin problema, readaptandose con oportunismo y sin escrupulos a la nueva situation politica.</s><s>El diagnostico sobre el estado de la sociedad italiana despues de veinte anos de dictadura imponia a los antifascistas una tarea prioritaria: no bastaba con haber derrotado militarmente al fascismo, era necesario tambien poner en marcha una operacion capilar de reeducacion de las masas para levantar sobre bases solidas un nuevo Estado democratico.</s><s>Esta accion reeducativa era considerada especialmente urgente con las nuevas generaciones, y el debate en torno a ellas permite al historiador deducir algunas informaciones importantes sobre la naturaleza del regimen fascista.</s><s>Una de ellas, que el aparato organizativo del regimen no habia sido esa escenografia teatral de carton-piedra, incapaz de trasmitir su propia vision del mundo y sus valores a las nuevas generaciones.</s><s>Al contrario, los efectos de la pedagogia fascista o como minimo el vacio de culturas politicas alternativas creado por ella, no solo se habian manifestado claramente en el pasado, sino que persistian en el presente convirtiendo a toda una generation en incapaz para el ejercicio de la libre y consciente ciudadania democratica.</s></p><p><s>El rechazo de la democracia y, sobre todo, de los valores y la politica del antifascismo derivaba sin duda de la inexperiencia en la practica democratica y de la incapacidad de valorar de manera realista las relaciones politicas de la Italia de posguerra.</s><s>Lo cual suponia, ademas, un escamotage para reconstruir la continuidad de la trayectoria biografica, para intentar mantener unidas las experiencias del pasado con las perspectivas del presente.</s><s>En otras palabras, los jovenes trataban de delinear los contornos de «otro antifascismo», porque suscribir el antifascismo de sus padres, que consideraba la experiencia fascista como una pura negatividad a borrar completamente de la memoria colectiva, habria significado renegar de si mismos, del propio pasado, de la propia identidad.</s></p><p><s>La demanda de un orden posfascista que integrase la experiencia y los valores de la «generacion del littorio» no era un legado ideologico fascista, si se entiende como la fe persistente en sus mitos, sino que dejaba entrever un condicionamiento mucho mas profundo ejercido por la dictadura, un modo de entender la politica que sobrevivia a la caida del regimen y que actuaba incluso sobre individuos que habian abandonado el horizonte historico e ideologico del fascismo.</s><s>En otros terminos, el rechazo a vivir la politica democratica, con su relativismo, su pragmatismo y sus compromisos era el sintoma -detectado por los contemporaneos -de la permanencia de una concepcion «integralista» de la politica adquirida durante los anos de formacion, una idea de la politica como activi- dad capaz de satisfacer cada necesidad de la persona, la primera de ellas la exigencia identitaria.</s><s>Una urgencia advertida, por ejemplo, por un intelectual como Franco Fortini, quien, desde la participation en los Littoriali de la cultura y del arte -competition cultural organizada por el regimen fascista entre los jovenes de las escuelas y universidades -, habia pasado a la lucha partisana y de alii a la militancia socialista.</s><s>Todavia a principios de 1948 este escritor sostenia que la reinsertion de los jovenes en el sistema democratico no podia darse aun por concluida, a causa de la incapacidad de los partidos para comprender «la novedad de la experiencia vivida por las generaciones mas jovenes».</s></p><p><s>En su denuncia del caracter burocratico e ideologico del antifascismo afloraba seguramente el resentimiento por la persistente exclusion de muchos jovenes, pero tambien resonaba en ella el eco de esa aspiration etica de la politica, que hiciera posible recomponer las distintas esferas de la existencia humana y responder a sus numerosas necesidades.</s><s>Una idea que habia constituido y seguia constituyendo, aun en nombre de nuevos valores, la idea-guia del compromiso militante de numerosos intelectuales.</s><s>Por eso Fortini decia hablar en nombre de todos «aquellos jovenes que hoy continuan su largo viaje para que no exista nunca mas una distincion entre vida privada y publica, entre poesia y politica, entre cultura y politica, no han olvidado sus origenes, la primera etapa de su viaje: y si el joven moralismo quizas se ha revestido de aparente cinismo, no por ello ha desaparecido.</s><s>Las distinciones tan estimadas por sus padres no le interesan: quieren una vida y una verdad total»83.</s><s>Tambien para Ruggero Zangrandi, a quien hemos citado antes, los jovenes «nuevos en la politica» se habian inscrito en los partidos antifascistas a coste de un penoso tormento interior para superar el fascismo y para madurar nuevos ideales.</s><s>Sin embargo, pronto se habian dado cuenta de que la vieja clase dirigente no era un ejemplo de virtud y de moralidad.</s><s>La «revuelta moral» consiguiente habia dado lugar a un reagrupamiento de los exfascistas en un «frente de la generation de en medio», situada en la oposicion a todos los partidos84.</s></p><p><s>83 Fortini, F.: «Un viaggio non finito», Avanti \\'!, 13 de enero de 1948.</s><s>84 Zangrandi, R.: «Verso un fronte della generazione di mezzo?»,</s><s>Rinascita, No solo la reconstruction de las trayectorias biograficas, por si mismas poco significativas, sino sobre todo el examen de los testimonios sobre los motivos de la propia evolution ideal y politica que han dejado los protagonistas nos permite avanzar en la hipotesis de que algunos elementos fundamentales de la originaria formation politica contribuyeron a determinar las nuevas opciones de los intelectuales.</s><s>Si bien en el nuevo clima las actitudes ideologicas maduradas durante el fascismo se injertaron dentro de culturas politicas muy distintas y dieron lugar a formas parcialmente ineditas.</s><s>Ademas, el hecho de que no se verificaran fenomenos significativos de migraciones politicas en masa desmiente una frecuente version de aquellos acontecimientos, segun la cual desde el fascismo era natural, por una supuesta contigiiidad ideologica, acabar militando en un partido en lugar de otro.</s><s>Sena equivocado deducir que la joven intelectualidad estaba atraida exclusivamente por el comunismo porque existia una especie de afinidad entre los dos totalitarismos85.</s></p><p><s>Los jovenes intelectuales fueron los unicos que reflexionaron publicamente, bien obligados a responder a las acusaciones de los mayores, bien porque fueron los mas duramente afectados por la crisis de valores producida por el desplome del regimen, sobre su propia desorientacion y su dificultad de inserirse nuevamente en el mundo politico y cultural.</s><s>Pero su salida del fascismo se produjo por itinerarios muy distintos.</s><s>En muchos casos, las convicciones politicas individuales se modificaron como consecuencia de experiencias personales, o por la perception del contexto externo.</s><s>En general, la definition de una nueva orientation fue el resultado de una compleja trama de reflexiones sobre el pasado y de necesidades psicologicas e identitarias, junto con el decisivo papel de las redes de amistades, la casualidad de los encuentros y las oportunidades que se presentaron a cada uno86.</s><s>Pese a la dificultad de reducir a un esquema tipico todos esos itinerarios biograficos y existenciales muy tortuosos y accidentados, se podrian distinguir al menos tres tendencias principales, tres opciones ideales en ese recorrido de abandono del fascismo.</s></p><p><s>85 Por ejemplo, Buchignani, P.: Fascisti rossi.</s><s>Da Said al Pci: la storia sconosciuta di una migrazione <ref type=\"bibr\">politica, 1943</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">-1953</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">, Milan, Mondadori, 1998, o</ref>  El segundo itinerario fue el recorrido por aquellos que eligieron una forma de continuidad ideal incluso en la discontinuidad de las opciones politicas.</s><s>La recuperacion selectiva de algunos temas del programa social y popular del regimen y la persistente fascinacion por los mitos de palingenesia social pudo favorecer una llegada al Partido Comunista o al Partido Socialista.</s><s>Desenmascarado el «engano» fascista, con su retorica anticapitalista y antiburguesa contra las fuerzas conservadoras, permanecia en el fondo la aspiracion a una accion social y revolucionaria.</s><s>Se trato, como es obvio, de una recuperacion selectiva del pasado destinada a enfatizar las continuidades ideales dejando de lado otros elementos ideologicos -el nacionalismo, el imperialismo o el racismo -que habian caracterizado en igual medida la actividad intelectual de los jovenes fascistas.</s></p><p><s>La tercera opcion fue la elegida por quienes llevaron a cabo su personal transicion a traves de una radical ruptura y un completo cambio no solo del marco ideologico, sino tambien de los valores individuales.</s><s>Reconociendo el caracter utopico del ideal revolucionario, de cualquier revolucion, se distanciaron de su infatuacion juvenil con los mitos colectivos del Estado totalitario y pasaron a defender una autentica politica liberal al servicio de la colectividad y de la persona.</s><s>Fue el caso, por ejemplo, de Vittorio Zincone, quien, partiendo del propio conocimiento de los mecanismos del Estado totalitario gracias a su condicion de dirigente de organizaciones politicas del regimen, se dedico luego a la denuncia del caracter irracional y antihumano de los totalitarismos tanto de derecha como de izquierda87.</s><s>En suma, el debate sobre la cuestion de los jovenes permite sacar a la luz un hecho a menudo marginado por los historiadores.</s><s>Desde la perspectiva de las culturas y las ment alidades, la transition al posfascismo y la reorganization de la vida publica italiana de posguerra no se llevo a cabo bajo el signo de la discontinuidad, sino que estuvo condicionada de manera importante por los rastros dejados en la sociedad por veinte anos de pedagogia totalitaria.</s><s>El analisis de las actitudes de la juventud intelectual no agota, por supuesto, el tema de los legados de la dictadura.</s><s>Sin embargo, si se pone en relation con la discusion mas general sobre los efectos del dominio totalitario que protagonizaron observadores fiables por parte antifascista, puede ser tomada como un indicador de procesos mas profundos y solo parcialmente analizables por las dificultades ya mencionadas en la introduction.</s></p><p><s>El caso de los jovenes intelectuales exfascistas demuestra que la transition al posfascismo se caracterizo por la dificultad de muchos italianos para emanciparse de la formation recibida y de la mentalidad asimilada en los anos de la dictadura, y para reconstruirse una nueva identidad compatible con los valores ahora dominantes de democracia y libertad.</s><s>La misma dialectica politica dentro de cada partido estuvo influida por la confluencia de diferentes componentes generacionales, que se caracterizaban por una distinta vision del pasado y diferentes proyectos para el futuro.</s><s>El recorrido hacia el antifascismo y la democracia por parte de las generaciones crecidas bajo el regimen mussoliniano -y no solo ellas -fue, por tanto, lento y trabajoso, resultado de un atormentado proceso de evolution ideal y de maduracion politica que solo unos pocos habian iniciado en los ultimos anos del regimen y que para muchos siguio mucho mas alia de su caida.</s><s>Esa fue la razon de que una parte de la juventud intelectual, en lugar de participar activamente en la reconstruction del pais como parecia logico, permaneciera bastante tiempo en una position de rechazo o de indiferencia respecto a la nueva Italia antifascista.</s></p><p><s>Por lo demas, los dirigentes antifascistas eran conscientes de que la tarea de sacar al pais fuera del fascismo ocuparia a la clase politica durante los proximos anos.</s><s>Como escribio el intelectual y periodista Panfilo Gentile a principios de 1947, si los fascistas o los Luca La Rovere Los intelectuales italianos y la transition al posfastismo neofascistas representaban tan solo a una minoria desdenable y ya no suponian una amenaza, la insidia mayor provenia de aquel sentimiento antidemocratico aun ampliamente extendido: «E1 regimen democratico marcha con un ejercito enemigo en sus flancos o, si se quiere, por una masa que respecto a la democracia no tiene mas sentimientos que la desconfianza y el desprecio»88.</s></p><p><s>[Traduction del italiano : Javier Munoz Soro] 88 Gentile, P.: «L\\'altro fascismo», Risorgimento liberate, 28 de marzo de 1947.</s></p></div><figure

extra-parliamentary manifestations of Southern European extreme and moderate right activism from a sociological, historical, and political science perspective.</s><s>We concentrate for the most part on changes that have recently been undertaken by these political parties and movements in terms of ideology, political discourse, organizational structures, and action strategies.</s></p><p><s>The present volume is the result of the joint analysis, collaboration, and fruitful dialogue among participants of the Conference of the Italian Political Science Association <ref type=\"bibr\">(Rome, September 2009)</ref>, and the Congress of the Portuguese Association of Political Science <ref type=\"bibr\">(Aveiro, March 2010)</ref>.</s><s>During these conferences, the contributors\\' attention was primarily focused on the analysis of single case studies within a more general framework that underlined the development of the extreme right over the last two decades.</s></p><p><s>These changes can be considered as the result of an interaction of different challenges that all parties -radical right not being excludedhave to face: an evident trans-nationalization of the political process (e.g., globalization) along with the effects of the European integration on the one hand, and the professionalization of politics in terms of political communication, action strategies, and organizational structures on the other.</s></p><p><s>These factors strongly affect extreme right parties and movements all over Europe, and it is the editors\\' opinion that focussing on these develop-ments can help to broaden the already existing literature on the radical right toward new research questions.</s></p><p><s>In the last two decades the radical right has experienced a significant rise in many West European democracies, both in terms of electoral success, with the gain of parliamentary and even governmental influence, and the mushrooming of many extra-parliamentary organizations (see among others, <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">Mudde, 2007;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">Koopmans et al. , 2005;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Norris, 2005;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">Carter, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Radical right parties and movements can count on a broad repertoire of \"enemies\": the European integration, immigration, the introduction of the Euro, the rising unemployment rate and the relevant traditional parties\\' social policies and economic politics.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RADICAL RIGHT</head><p><s>Internationalization processes are mentioned by many scholars as o the main causes of the recent mobilization of the extreme right in E as a reaction against the structural, economic, and cultural changes br about by modernity <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">(Mény and Surel, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Euro-skeptical position nationalism are considered to be two crucial elements of the new righ \"populism\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">(Mudde, 2007;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">Kriesi et al ., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Some studies consider the rise of the extreme right as a reaction ag post-materialism <ref type=\"bibr\">(Minkenberg, 1992)</ref>.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">Betz (1994)</ref> interprets the dev ment of the contemporary radical right as a form of \"late modern populi and following <ref type=\"bibr\">Ignazi\\'s interpretation (1992</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Ignazi\\'s interpretation ( , 1994) )</ref> the rise of radical parties should be understood as the product of a \"silent counter-revol culturally characterized by a tendency toward \"neo-conservatism\" ( 245).</s><s>Some authors, such as <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">Heitmeyer (1992)</ref>, refer more precisely influence of \"anti-modernity/globalization\" factors.</s></p><p><s>The attention that scholars devote to the definitional aspects and t identification of the reasons for these parties\\' emergence is reflected use of different labels to identify the same political subjects.</s><s>This is fested, for instance, in the never-ending terminological discussion abo nature of these political subjects, which includes references to their \"extr right\", \"far right\", \"fascist\", \"radical\", \"populist\" main character.</s></p><p><s>The debate on the ideological profile of the radical right has tended to mainly on party organizations and to neglect the development of other so based organizations.</s><s>Moreover, it has mostly focussed on countries radical-right parties have been more electorally successful (e.g., in Au or where extreme right movements were particularly violent (e.g., i many), leaving aside some of the countries where the radical right w 626 electorally strong and socially rooted -Spain and Portugal, for in Apart from the above described controversies, some general tendencies can be identified in the development process of these parties and movements.</s><s>During the last two decades, the radical right has, in fact, undergone changes in three main directions: ideology, strategy, and organization.</s></p><p><s>Ideologically , as noted above, radical-right parties have shifted to a populist platform and a populist form of communication.</s><s>The issues included in their manifestos, as well as the main communication strategies implemented in order to reach a broader electorate, are common to those expressed by right-wing populist parties not deriving from extreme right ideological traditions.</s><s>This shift toward a more populist rather than extreme right nature is reflected not only in the reduction or elimination of historical references to extreme right historical movements typical of the post-industrial radical right <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">(Ignazi, 1994)</ref>, but also in the inclusion in the party platform of issues calling for the protection of the native community, the valuing of the traditional family based on Christian principles, opposition to the Islamic culture and the Islamic \"invasion\" of Western countries, and the opposition to economic globalization phenomena, as well as a multi-faced and variable scepticism toward the European Union <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">(Mudde, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The common nature of these parties\\' platforms can moreover be considered as a starting point for the creation of bridges between radical-right parties and radical-right movements.</s><s>Strategically , the above described convergence toward an ideological profile capable of capturing a broader electorate can be perceived as a way for these parties to intercept the so-called \"protest voters\".</s><s>The rising economic difficulties, the world-wide financial crisis, and the related feelings of uncertainty create a favorable terrain for a more open competition of these parties with the moderate right.</s><s>In order to better implement this strategy, communication plays a central role.</s><s>As <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">Mazzoleni, Stewart, and Horsfield (2003)</ref> show, media have played a central role in the legitimization of these parties, not only in the cases of new right populist parties such as the Italian Lega Nord , but also in the above described evolution of extreme right parties toward a more populist approach (as evidenced in the cases of the French National Front and the Freiheitliche Partei Österreich ).</s></p><p><s>The organization of radical-right parties and movements has had to adapt to the new constraints created by these ideological and strategic shifts through a process of professionalization of the relationship with the electorate.</s><s>This professionalization process is reflected not only in the adoption of the communication techniques of the so-called third phase of political communication, but also in the adaptation of the different party \"faces\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">(Katz and Mair, 1994)</ref> to the phenomena of personalization and leadership.</s><s>From this point of view, the \"party on the ground\" is particularly affected by this organizational change, not only in the central, but also its local branches.</s><s>&lt;52

between moderate right-wing political forces and actors and \"radical\" ones, in terms of propaganda, mutual selflocation in the political space, and competition for the vote <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">(Kriesi, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the analysis of the moderate and extreme right is relevant from the point of view of their reciprocal influences.</s><s>Scientific literature has evidenced complementary and sometimes contradictory elements concerning these aspects.</s><s>Their investigation in a comparative perspective, with particular attention to the parties\\' self-collocation on the right-wing continuum, is particularly interesting.</s><s>Some authors underline how the moderate right in the opposition can generate difficulties to the radical right.</s><s>In this case, radical-right parties have to face a more \"tempting\" competitor.</s><s>On the contrary, the moderate right\\'s inclusion in the government can facilitate the anti-establishment discourse of the radical right <ref type=\"bibr\">(Kriesi, 1999, p. 419)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, the inclusion of radical policies in the moderate right\\'s political agenda precludes the possibility for the extreme right to exploit sensitive issues for public opinion <ref type=\"bibr\">(von Beyme, 1998, p. 15)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, other authors underline how the shift to the right of moderate parties does not compromise radical-right parties.</s><s>On the contrary, it would legitimize their political discourse, thus facilitating their success.</s></p><p><s>On the political side, alternative considerations concern the implementation of disproportional electoral systems and, on the social side, the effects of the economic crisis (mainly growing unemployment).</s></p><p><s>Regarding the introduction of disproportional systems, empirical research shows that the extreme-right elector does not seem to be discouraged from the existence of non-proportional systems, usually introduced by mainstream parties.</s><s>On the other hand, the extreme right electorate seems to tend to vote for mainstream right parties in periods of economic crisis (Arzheimer and <ref type=\"bibr\">Carter, 2006, p. 439)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is important to analyze the effect of the exploitation of political cleavages as well.</s><s>Radical-right parties have difficulties in gaining a political space in which they can act, while mainstream right parties still hold the monopoly of traditional and still influenciai cleavages <ref type=\"bibr\">(Kriesi, 1999, p. 410</ref>).</s><s>On the contrary, the permanence of elevated conflict in the traditional cleavages, the emergence of new cleavages not completely exploited by the moderate right, and their combination with the \"representation crisis\" can open up new opportunities for radical-right political actors, which are often \"newcomers\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Hainsworth, 2008, p. 26)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Moderate right leaders with a high charismatic profile (such as De Gaulle, Reagan, Thatcher) are often perceived by the potential electorate of the far reason, the former are preferred to the latter, who are considered, in comparison, as less sucessful in the political game.</s><s>Despite this, radical-right leaders can obtain the same self-promotion opportunities as moderate leaders by accurately managing their image in the mass media <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">(Bos, van der Brug, Vreese, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The reciprocal influence between moderate and extreme right on the above-mentioned aspects characterizes altogether the case studies presented in this Special Issue.</s></p><p><s>Finally, this Special Issue refers not only to political parties and elections, but also to non-party organizations and to the feature of political communication and the political discourse.</s><s>These elements are gaining importance in the extreme-right-specific literature.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">(Mazzoleni, Stewart, and Horsfield, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>It is indeed evident that making use of an anti-establishment and antiparty rhetoric, radical-right and populist parties and movements are able to gain visibility and mobilize citizens\\' disaffection feelings toward the national and European political class.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SPECIAL ISSUE</head><p><s>In terms of geography, the Special Issue focuses on the extreme in Southern European countries (i.e., France, Italy, Spain, and Port illustrating the specific characteristics of these scarcely explored right scenes and comparing them with other European cases.</s></p><p><s>The volume addresses the transnational dimension of the extreme underlying the opportunities and constraints of the processes of Eu integration and globalization.</s><s>The shifting of power from the national t supranational level affects not only mainstream political parties, i groups, and social movements, but radical-right parties and movem well (see also <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">Kriesi et al ., 2008;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Mudde, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The article by Nicolò Conti addresses the transnational dimension extreme right and its transformations (in terms of both orientati behaviors, i.e. vote) related to the European Union.</s><s>Examining extrem parties in 15 EU member states, he analyzes the correspondence betw public discourse toward the EU and the voting behavior of extrem parties\\' MEPs in the European Parliament.</s><s>Despite the traditional r right parties\\' opposition toward the EU and the relative criticism and ric, their voting behavior shows the expression of their dissent with prising\" respect for the institutional rules of the game.</s><s>\"Islamophobia\".</s><s>Since the turn of t terrorist attacks, this element has been feature of the European extreme-rig spotlight of the anti-globalization feeli theorization of a \"Eurabia\" future for the old continent.</s><s>In the author\\'s opinion, the visions of a Muslim settlement and the \"takeover\" of Europe have the potential to create a cross-national reconfiguration of the extreme right ideology and a sort of convergence between different sides of the extreme right ideological spectrum.</s></p><p><s>The article by Manuela Caiani and Linda Parenti investigates the use of the internet by extreme right organizations as a modern tool of political communication.</s><s>By focusing on the Spanish extreme right and conducting a formalized content analysis of about 90 right-wing organizational websites of different kinds (from extreme right political parties to sub-cultural skinhead groups, etc.), Caiani and Parenti explore the degree and the forms of use of the internet by these groups that underpin their different political purposes: propaganda, information, mobilization, etc. Particular attention is devoted by the authors to the interest of radical-right groups toward the potentiality of the Internet as a means for creating a transnational community.</s><s>The results of the study are interpreted on the basis of the existing political opportunities in the off-line reality of the Spanish context.</s></p><p><s>Among the contributions focusing on the national Southern European case studies and the current mainly ideological development of the right in these countries, Madalena Resende investigates the adaptation process of Spanish center-right parties and their difficult relationship with the past.</s><s>The chapter offers a comparison between the Spanish and the Polish center-right parties.</s><s>Taking into account the new scenario posed by the EU, the article describes and analyzes the attempts to transform introverted conceptions of nation into extroverted nationalism by the center-right political forces in the two countries.</s><s>It argues that the formation of a coalition where liberal reformists prevailed over nationalist conservatives proved to be a crucial condition to allow the reform of conceptualizations of the nation.</s><s>Whereas in Spain liberal reformists were predominant in the Partido Popular (PP) and the party proceeded to reform its nationalism, in Poland no such stable settlement between liberals and nationalists was reached.</s></p><p><s>Moving on to the Portuguese case, José Costa offers an investigation of the Portuguese radical right and its recent evolution in terms of both ideology and strategies since the mid-1980s.</s><s>Political far-right parties, as well as the broader \"far-right associative movement\", are taken into consideration.</s><s>In the period analyzed, the traditional counter-revolutionary, universal, and imperialist basis led to the myth that the multi-continental and multi-racial empire was 630 replaced by a racialist identity typical of the ethno-cultural nationalism.</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"

historical and political evolution of the radical-right Portuguese party and locates it in the broad European post-industrial extreme right.</s><s>Focusing on the Italian case, Ricardo Marchi\\' s

Mosse, who in the 1 960s were already regarded as experts in the field of fascism.</s><s>They nevertheless had to cope with the problem of defining a phenomenon of which there was no shared understanding.</s><s>The inflated use of the term \"as an all-purpose pejorative\" and as an epithet for \"any sort of authoritarianism that seems be best to limit the damage and abandon the notion of finding a satisfying definition of fascism, since the term, as Gilbert Allardyce categorically stated in 1979, \"virtually means nothing.\"7</s><s>Not very much has changed since then.</s><s>The ongoing and somewhat elastic use of the term fascism today and the recourse to old and familiar terms is the result -as an article in the New York Times pointed out some time agoof the failure to find the proper language for problems and phenomena that are bafflingly novel in an age in which religion and politics, modern technology and seemingly archaic beliefs are mixed together, in which media control and money have sometimes replaced force as a means of maintaining consensus.8</s></p><p><s>Unfortunately many of those who use the term \"fascism\" in a broader sense have only seldom done comparative work on those phenomena initially linked to the moniker during the interwar years; nor are they experts in terms of the movements original impulse -namely Italian fascism.</s><s>They have therefore only a limited insight into the politics and ideologies at work and are only rarely able to give a historiographie overview of the various concepts that go into defining \"fascism\".</s><s>To give one recent example: A bestselling book on \"liberal fascism\" in the United States makes out fascism to be a phenomenon of the political Left and points out the revolutionary roots of the original Italian fascism (which of course is not totally wrong).</s><s>It also draws strong connections between European fascism of the early 20th century and the Progressive Movement of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his New Deal.9</s><s>This may be a provocative and even stimulating idea, but viewed historically it stretches the concept of

by the overwhelming majority of historians.</s></p><p><s>Another misleading understanding and labeling of fascism can be seen in the political arena, especially since the terrorist attacks of 1 1 September 200 1 , and is directly related to the threats posed by al-Qaida and other radical Islamist movements.</s><s>Interestingly, this claim of a historic bond between Islam and fascism has been voiced from the political Left as well as by neo-conservative groups in a bid to prop up what are seen as \"Western values\".</s><s>The term fascism has been used, for instance, in widely publicized articles by Christopher Hitchens and Paul Berman, to link different forms of militant Islamic fundamentalism with the cult of violence, radical nationalism, and those anti-Jewish policies characteristic of a number of authoritarian movements in the early 20th century.</s><s>This has led to the frequently voiced opinion that people in the Arab World and especially Muslims generally lack the positive effects of secularization, that they easily accommodate to anti-Semitism and are ideologically predisposed to thinking in terms of authoritarian and \"fascist\" rule.</s><s>Certainly, some modern Islamist tradi-tions10 -for instance in the work of Sayyid Qutb, the most influential leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood1 1 resemble and have historical links to those movements in the first half of the 20th century that worshipped extreme nationalism, ethnocentrism, and anti-Semitism.</s></p><p><s>Yet, even if one agrees that the Islamism of today is a post-Enlightenment and

but merged with syndicalist, futurist and nationalist ideas as well, some of them having their cradle in a left-wing anti-bourgeois setting.</s><s>Because fascism changed its political and ideological course several times before it came to power, from the beginning it was difficult to determine what it basically represented.</s><s>Unlike more dominant movements such as liberalism or socialism, it was not based upon nor did it develop an elaborate philosophical system but was rather founded on \"popular feelings about master races, their unjust lot, and their rightful predominance over inferior

experience.</s><s>When in 1934 the Italian regime organized a \"Fascist International Congress\" in Montreux on Lake Geneva, movements in 39 countries were judged to have attained to the label \"fascist\" and were thus allowed to participate.</s><s>But from the outset the conference was hindered by serious quarrels between the various participants and the sections they represented.</s><s>A follow-up meeting in Amsterdam in 1935 also failed to define what \"fascism\" should mean, nor was it able to bridge the gap between the goals and expectations of the various movements in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.</s><s>In other words, the international fascist movement was ultimately unable to come to terms with what it was about.</s><s>All participating movements insisted on and jealously guarded their own particular ideas as to the way to \"national revival\", and so a common understanding or united policy was lacking.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, \"international fascism\" proved a failure, faded into oblivion, and was never revived.15</s></p><p><s>The disagreements and controversies among those who considered themselves as \"fascists\" partly explain why historians have found it so difficult to define the new political trends of the interwar period.</s><s>In search of an adequate definition, they must first identify those countries which developed significant movements with shared features and thereby -because they would lead to unacceptable dilution and conflation of the concept -eliminating those more traditional movements that might be termed merely \"populist\" or \"nationalist\".</s></p><p><s>Ever since the aforementioned research of Weber, Nolte and Mosse, movements have been regarded as fascist if they contained several key and clearly recognizable components: anti-Marxism, anti-liberalism, a partial anti-conservatism, the existence of a party army, and the leaderprinciple.</s><s>These components are seen as the \"fascist minimum\".16</s><s>Several key aspects must be added though.</s><s>The Italian historian Emilio Gentile, who took a close look at the metaphysical aspects of Italian  A new set of movements, which can be partly regarded as fascist, strived for a uomo nuovo , a \"new man\", which in the German case was the \"aryanized\" man, and they were in revolt against modern secularized and democratic society.</s><s>Even when their protagonists tried to roll back the Enlightenment and the \"Ideas of 1789\", their ideology was a \"direct by-product of aspects of the Enlightenment, derived specifically from the modern, secular, Promethean concepts of the eighteenth century\".19</s></p><p><s>The extraordinary appeal and attraction to new forms of organization  eral European movements appealed to different traditions, national myths and prejudices; and then there was the seductive power of totalitarian regimes and their ability to manipulate the dynamics of \"mass and power\", the notion of the alienating effects of secularization, and the concomitant rise of political religions.</s><s>On the other hand, it is equally evident that in its bid for total control and mass mobilization, fascism cannot be considered \"simply a more muscular form of conservatism\",31 even if it maintained the existing economic and social order.</s><s>But while trying to generalize, classify and taxonomize, categorization still remains difficult.</s><s>Should various forms of religious fundamentalism, authoritarianism and racism be included?</s><s>In the end there are still more questions than answers: One of the major obstacles in finding a common denominator remains the case of National Socialism with its unique history of ever greater radicalization and the formerly unheard-of extermination policy.</s></p><p><s>One important school of thought contests that the Third Reich and its genocidal tendencies can be labelled \"fascist\".</s><s>Yet, even when concentrating on the evolution and development of the regimes in Rome and Berlin in the interwar years, there have always been caveats when it came to direct comparisons between fascism in Italy and National Socialism in Germany.46</s><s>The consensus would seem to be that the radicalization which took place in Italy in the late 1 930s -the country\\'s anti-Semitic policies as well as its colonial racism -shows greater similarities than dissimilarities between the two regimes.47</s><s>But as there are significant differences in the scope and style of the two regimes, further research would appear to be necessary -and this somewhat hapless conclusion can be found in the final pages of nearly every book and article on \"fascism\".</s><s>Up until now it has been a vain hope that continuing research will provide that missing element which finally shows the essential nature of fascism -and there is no reason to assume that more research will in fact eventually reveal it.</s><s>Any comparison must take into account the uniqueness of the road to Auschwitz, which was integral to National Socialism.</s><s>This makes it difficult to lump the German case with minor \"fascist\" movements in Scandinavia, for instance, where even the ultra-right authoritarian movements were too religious and conservative to embrace the novel ideology.</s><s>It is no coincidence that most scholars of National Socialism shy away from even using the term But if the fascist and National Socialist regimes cannot even be lumped together, what then is the sense in looking for similarities between various minor movements that had not even attained to the status of a regime?</s><s>Does it make sense to apply the concept of fascism to other movements with entirely different origins, especially to smaller ones with different historical backgrounds and which had hardly any impact on the political landscape of their respective societies?</s><s>Apart Roger Griffins 1991 groundbreaking book The Nature of Fascism provided a fresh new look at the phenomenon\\'s theoretical aspects, describing fascism as \"a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic form of populist ultranationalism\".52</s><s>As the preeminent scholar of the \"generic\" concept of fascism (meaning the transcending of place and time, in this case Europe and the interwar period), Griffin has subsequently refined an ideal type of \"fascism\" that defines its \"mythic core\" as \"the vision of the (perceived) crisis of the nation as betokening the birth-pangs of a new order\".53</s><s>In stark contrast to scholars like Nolte and Payne, he also argues that the fascist epoch did not come to an end in 1945 but remains profoundly connected to modernization and modernity, although he basically reserves the term for European movements.54</s><s>Griffin argues that a certain amount of secularization, a broadened suffrage, and a democratic setting were necessary prerequisites for the emergence of fascism, which used the attractions of traditional religion but distorted its values.</s><s>In those countries where secularization and \"nationalization\" was minimal the conditions to create the necessary historical consciousness for emergence of fascism did not exist.55</s></p><p><s>It is easy to understand why Griffin s \"generic\" fascism has not found universal support.</s><s>His declaration of a \"new consensus\"56 regarding the acceptance of his concept has been vehemently contested.</s><s>His singling out of the rebirth of a nation and its \"mythic core\" may be ingenious,    Racial superiority or the dream of a \"master race\" was not on the agenda of even the most radical of the nationalist youth movements.</s></p><p><s>They lacked the radical racial ideology of Hitler s Germany and its long history of Christian anti-Semitism, which was a specific European phenomenon also detectable in France and Poland.</s><s>The literature and other contemporary sources of information contain little that is comparable to the \"deep-seated and comprehensive\" anti-Semitism of the Third If what is meant by \"nationalism\" is racial self-aggrandizement to a degree which leads to the disparagement of other races, aggression against them and their victimization for the sake of the nations glory and its continuing existence, as preached for example by Germany and Italy; nay more, as claimed by every nation which preaches its superiority over all others -then this is a reprehensible idea.118</s></p><p><s>One of the most obvious reasons for the popularity of the notion of \"mercenaries of fascism\", which Wiesen thai characterized not as freedom fighters but as \"political gangsters\".127</s><s>This has led to a

a factor in the Holocaust and whether Islam is a barbaric or civilizing force.129</s><s>Several Shawkat, director of the Ministry of Education.</s><s>The Iraqi movement was easily the most militant in

Reichsjugendfiihrer Baldur von Schirach paid a visit in late 1937 not only to Damascus and Tehran but also to Baghdad.</s><s>The fiituwwa movement in 1 936 saw itself as a \"modern military organization based on the most modern system, which imbues youth with military spirit and the spirit of sacrifice, love of discipline and obedience to orders\".141</s><s>Its members were subjected to a barrage of appeals.</s><s>There were frequent references to Hitler and Mussolini, and the \"Art of Death\" and sacrifice was constantly evoked.</s><s>This hinted at a general mood which had pervaded in Europe since before the First World War, when Futurists had seen war and bloodshed as a way of neutralizing the boredom generated by bourgeois society.</s><s>In Iraq it was adapted to foster the idea of the awakening Arab nation -in Shawkat s view the only practicable method of succeeding in the fight against the Great Powers was by instilling firmness and toughness.</s><s>Although Shawkat developed the idea of a superior Arab national character, he felt that other nations should not be forced into the Arab fold but would willingly join it by virtue of its

The Ba\\'th party\\'s principal ideologue, Mlshïl ťAflaq, later brought these radical, romantic, national and pan-Arabic ideas back from France where he had been studying;150 but this does not mean that they were essentially fascist. \\'Aflaqs partly secular movement was undoubtedly influenced by the mood in Vichy France -he framed his political agenda into an ideology which was simultaneously secular, anti-liberal, anti-Western and anti-communist. In Palestine the situation was even more complex and dynamic.151 Individuals such as Avraham Stern, a Jew, were supporters of Hitler not because of his anti-Semitic diatribes but because his visions of statehood ests, even when his autocratic movement became a paramilitary organization with weekly training sessions. Certainly the mandate sys-tem and the growing influx of Jewish refugees from Europe led to a situation in which support for extremist groups was to be expected.154 But in order to gain support in the broader society and be able to form a specific Lebanese nationalism -in line with Arab nationalism -these military exercises were soon cut back, and there is little evidence that the movement, which had no clear-cut racist or expansionist program, was substantially influenced by European fascism.155 VI. Hitler and \"Fascism\" in the Arab World in the 1930s: A Sphere of Mutual Instrumentalization Hitler never even conceived of a universal fascism and would have rejected any notion that his movement and regime were comparable to that of Mussolini, with whom he shared a \"brutal friendship\".156 He had already made clear in Mein Kampf that although opposed to British rule in India and in Egypt, he did not intend this to mean solidarity with the oppressed, being convinced of their racial \"Minderwertigkeit\".157 Outside of Europe, Hitler saw his major areas of focus not in the Middle East but in East Asia and the United States.158 It speaks for itself that command was informed that he was interested in Arabs only as a means of inciting disturbances -he labeled Arabs \"lackierte Halbaffen\" (\"var-nished prosimians\") who were eager to feel the whip.160 His opinions differed little from those of his opponent Winston Churchill, who in 1951, annoyed by Egyptian aspirations for the Suez Canal, instructed one of his diplomats: \"Hitler s policy in the Middle East was adamantly opposed to French and British colonial rule, but it was not a policy of liberation. Mussolini and Hitler, both latecomers to the imperial banquet [...] did not want to end empire but to redistribute it. They believed that the liberal imperialists in France and Britain, as with their domestic policies, lacked the necessary ruthlessness and vigor to govern their vast empires. They had either to make way or shape up, sympathies. What followed was geopolitics. Both sides, certain Italian much more powerful local fascist party was convinced of the superior-important during the Second World War). Even when the Peel Parti-and German officials, and certain Arab leaders, tried to outmaneuver one another, and what followed was less an expression of mutual under-standing and ideological conviction than a mere reflection of the old game of Realpolitik.164 youth and emerging middle classes. They proved to be fertile ground for fascist propaganda, although the scope of these efforts, as interesting they may be, should not be exaggerated.166 As already mentioned, the idea of \"international fascism\" had found resonance in certain Italian government circles, resulting in conferences on the subject. When Mus-tion Plan of 1937 generated a debate about German policy in the Middle East -and strict opposition in Germany to creation of an inde-pendent Jewish state coincided with Arab opposition as well -it still did not result in any active involvement, and when the partition scheme died, very little changed.173 ity of the Forth Shore.

awarded Günter Grass its literature prize earlier this year, it recognized his stature not only as a novelist but as Germany\\'s leading polemicist.</s><s>Whether it was hitting the campaign trail for socialist Chancellor Willy Brandt in the late 1960s or condemning German reunification, the gloomy, walrus-moustached Grass has made a career of battling the German conservatives he refers to as \"skinheads in neckties.\"</s><s>Today, the newly minted Nobel laureate appears on talk shows to celebrate the meltdown of the Christian Democratic Union.</s></p><p><s>Like Heinrich Boll, the first German postwar novelist to win the Nobel, Grass exemplifies the decisive influence the Left has had in shaping contemporary German political culture.</s><s>Germany\\'s intelligentsia spent much of the Cold War banging its tin drums against consumer capitalism, American imperialism and an imminent resurgence of fascism.</s><s>Its poets, novelists and critics viewed themselves as the first line of defense against a return to the Third Reich and insisted that it was their fundamental duty to marry literature with politics.</s><s>To an extent inconceivable in the United States, the German literary class has functioned as the nation\\'s self-Jacob Heilbrunn is a columnist for Süddeutsche Zeitung.</s></p><p><s>appointed moral and political conscience.</s></p><p><s>But to the dismay of <ref type=\"bibr\">Grass &amp; Co.,</ref> with reunification an intellectual advance guard composed of former leftists such as the novelist Martin Walser has emerged to champion German national pride.</s></p><p><s>Among other things, this new literary Right maintains that the Holocaust has been wielded as a \"moral cudgel\" by foreign powers to shame Germany.</s></p><p><s>Dismissing as guilt-ridden humbug the summons of the influential political philosopher Jürgen Habermas for a \"constitutional patriotism\", it decries the literary Left and its long-held taboos.</s><s>For much of the history of the Federal Republic, leftist writers espoused an anti-American nationalism that argued for a German Sonderweg, or special path, which in practice meant neutrality in the superpower conflict.</s><s>Now the literary Right, emboldened by reunification, is arguing for its own version of a special path.</s><s>No one was to epitomize this con- By the 1980s, the anathemas pronounced by the German intelligentsia knew few bounds.</s><s>Bernt Engelmann, the official spokesman of the Writers Association of the Federal Republic, declared, \"We should finally separate ourselves from anything that has to do with the wish to restore a German nationstate.\"</s><s>The novelist Friedrich Dürrenmatt announced that, henceforth, \"Germany\" would be a term \"that will only exist in memory, in nostalgia, in sentimentality, and finally in the past.</s><s>The best response that Grass could muster was a fulmination about East Germans traveling to Berlin to eat fresh fruit, while Jürgen Habermas railed about a DM-nationalism taking over Eastern Europe.</s><s>Meanwhile less extreme members of the literary Left had begun defecting to the Right, some, indeed, now conceding that communist totalitarianism was as pernicious as Nazism, and in many ways similar to it.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Politics of the</head><p><s>These themes, of course, had been percolating on the Right for some time, at least since the Historikerstreit, or historians\\' dispute, that rocked Germany in 1986.</s><s>The debate raised, in the most fundamental and painful way, the question of German identity -whether, after Auschwitz, Germany could, or even should, aspire to be a \"normal\" nation.</s><s>But for leftists such as Habermas, the mere consideration of these questions amounted to a dangerous plot to resurrect the old Adam of German nationalism.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>The dispute began when historian Ernst Nolte published an essay in the</head><p><s>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called \"The Past That Will Not Pass Away.\"</s><s>In it, Nolte argued that the Holocaust was not unique: Lenin\\'s Red Terror, in fact, had been a dress rehearsal for the murder of the Jews, and Hitler, in any case, was merely responding to his fear of a With reunification, Walser\\'s views sharpened still further.</s><s>In his lengthy autobiographical novel, A Flowing Well , which appeared in 1998, he tackled the question of personal memory and the Nazi era by devising an alter ego named Johann.</s><s>In Johann \\'s telling of that period there is only a fleeting reference to a Jewish character and the word Auschwitz never appears.</s><s>The Americanization of Germany is portrayed as unnecessary and a mistake.</s><s>By contrast, Walser depicts the Nazi era as a normal time for most Germans, or about as normal as life during wartime can be.</s><s>He suggests that economic misery made it logical for Germans to join the Nazi party; Johann\\'s mother becomes a party member merely to draw business away from a rival pub and rescue her establishment from likely financial

not surprisingly, this difference is historical in nature.</s><s>Tafuri -to roughly summarize part of his intellectual project -criticized the naive ambitions of postwar architects, claiming not only that they should in no way pretend to influence contemporary societal conditions but also that the expression of these conditions was futile, since it would never be heard by society in general, let alone understood.</s><s>Trying to understand, communicate, or fight the facts and the circumstances of modern existence by means of architecture had become, after the demise of the Modern Movement, a rather silly undertaking.</s><s>Quite The widespread conviction that architecture has no social role worth speaking of is illustrated in a curious document from the heyday of late 20th-century Dutch architecture culturea culture that has been crucial in the formation of Aureli and Tattara, who were students and educators at the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam before it was closed in 2012 due to government budget cuts.</s></p><p><s>In There lies an important irony in this formula.</s><s>As Ibelings unwittingly but succinctly described, in contemporary architecture one major ideological dogma became all the more huge precisely because it was never expressed as such: that architects have no use for ideals, nor for explicit or societal programs that contradict or confront the way of the world.</s></p><p><s>The name Dogma, chosen by Aureli and Tattara, can be interpreted in this sense: their projects polemically address an architecture culture that is dominated by one dogma, with a working and production method that is no less dogmaticbut it is a dogma that, on the one hand, is put in a theoretical and self-willed pole position and, on the other, uncovers and reverses many of the fetishes and doxas of 21st-century architecture.</s><s>The work of Dogma is -to borrow from Ibelings\\'s catalogue once more -not \"inventive,\" and it does not boast \"a tremendous richness of form.\"</s><s>Invention and formal richness are, on the contrary, considered as the true, self-consuming problem of architecture and, as such, are annihilated, not least by the use of one formal dogma: the square.</s><s>This is the conceptual basis of their approach, and it has often led to bewildered reactions, comic and sad at the same time: How can they be serious?</s><s>Is that all there is?

with its past and reaching a shared inter history.</s></p><p><s>Contextualising the historiography on the Italian Communist Party since 1991 by locating it in the framework of Italian political debate, this article is aimed at bringing together two related threads.</s><s>It will chart how the history of the PCI became a political issue and how the PCI\\'s historiographical reassessment intertwined with other highly controversial topics such as the moral and political legacy of the Italian resistance and the re-evaluation of the fascist regime.</s><s>Meanwhile, the article will analyse the keys moments of the PCI historiographical revision of the 1990s, focusing particularly on the issues which contributed to the shaping of the current perception of the PCI as a non-democratic political party: the Stalinism of Palmiro Togliatti and his subordination to Moscow, the real impetus behind the Svolta di Salerno policy.</s><s>The final section will draw some conclusions, discussing how the politicization of PCI history fundamentally affected the historiographical debate surrounding the Italian Communist Party, over the last 20 years, and will suggest new approaches for research into PCI history.</s></p><p><s>The historiographical reassessment of the PCI of the nineties assumed a political character because it originated in the political field, and its roots can be traced in the ideological and political friction between the PSI ( Partito Socialista Italiano -Italian Socialist Party) and the PCI of Enrico Berlinguer at the end of the 1970s.</s><s>Aiming to reverse the progressive political marginalization of the PSI caused by Berlinguer\\'s policy of the Compromesso storico , the socialist leader Bettino Craxi challenged the PCI on the ideological plane, denouncing the totalitarian character of every form of communism as being opposed to the libertarian and non-Leninist tradition of the kind of socialism embodied by the PSI.12</s><s>This provoked an ideological skirmish which coincided with the deterioration of political relations between the two historic parties of the Italian left.13</s><s>In March 1988, the polemic shifted from an ideological to a historical level, following the conference on 12 On the publication of the so-called Vangelo socialista , attributed to Craxi but actually written by Luciano Pellicani, in the magazine l\\'Espresso in 1978, see L. Musella, Craxi (Rome 2007), 155-66.</s><s>13 For a general overview about the PCI-PSI quarrel in the 1980s see S.

Naples and one of the most prominent of Occhetto\\'s advisors, entitled \\'Once upon a time there was Togliatti and real communism\\': 20 August 1989, the eve of the 25th anniversary of Togliatti\\'s death.</s><s>This was a dramatic transitional period for the international communist movement: the Berlin wall was still up, but the blood of the Chinese students had already been spilled in Tiananmen Square, and the crisis of the Eastern European communist regimes had clearly entered its final phase.</s><s>In this context De Giovanni claimed that Togliatti\\'s political thought and praxis were to be judged as jointly responsible for the political, economic and social disasters of comunismo reale , and therefore invited the Party to put behind it, without further delay, Togliatti\\'s cultural and political heritage.</s><s>The communist leadership was clearly trying to redefine the political and cultural background of the party.</s></p><p><s>However, De Giovanni\\'s strong statement, instead of being praised by noncommunist politicians and intellectuals as a positive development, was harshly criticized in several articles published immediately afterwards, especially by the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Avanti].16</s><s>It was not De Giovanni\\'s argument which provoked discussion, but the communists\\' attempt to reassess autonomously their historical heritage.</s><s>The large majority of noncommunist intellectuals, be they journalists or politicians, could not allow the PCI to get rid of its past in such an easy and, in their view, painless way, without paying in full the political and electoral price f mistakes.</s><s>Significantly, the Socialist Party, still led by forefront of this polemical offensive against the PCI, and fill the traditional electoral gap between the two Italian left.</s><s>The criticism against the PCI and its histo assumption that the PCI, being a communist party, was sible for the crimes perpetrated by communists all ove the end of the Italian Communist Party, which turned into the Partito Democratico della Sinistra (PDS) during the congress held in Rimini (30 since the leadership of the Italian Communist Party had drawn attention to Togliatti when, at the end of the 1980s, Occhetto had made a clear-cut attempt to distance the PCI from the Stalinist period of its past.</s><s>Togliatti\\'s biography was, however, scrutinized far more deeply than Occhetto would have wished.</s><s>The 18 years Togliatti spent in exile in Moscow raised questions about his role during Stalin\\'s purge of the 1930s, which he had survived, unlike the majority of the foreign communist leaders living in the Soviet Union at the time.</s><s>As early as 1991, the historian Gianni Corbi had compiled an accurate account of Togliatti\\'s complicity in endorsing Stalin\\'s persecution of the USSR\\'s foreign communities, including Italians, in the 1930s.19</s><s>This did not prevent the publication of many Left-wingers pretend they have changed, they claim they are l but it is not true, they are the same as before, their mentali deepest beliefs and their behaviour are just the same as before</s></p><p><s>The battlefield was the past, the history of the PCI and its r of Italian democracy: to deny the PCI any democratic cred weakening the very political legitimacy of the post-comm beginning of the second republic.</s><s>nuovo was rather a mass-based party, designed to enco participation in the political life of a fledgling democra policy was therefore a sort of

that Stalin was behind the Svolta di Salerno, which was probably imposed on a reluctant Togliatti after a meeting between the two during the night between 3 and 4 March 1944, proved beyond reasonable doubt by then newly available documents.52TheincreasinglyaccessibleSovietdocumentsfedinto the publications of Elena Aga Rossi and Victor Zaslavsky, both of whom seriously questioned the traditional interpretation of the PCI\\'s autonomy from Moscow.In their essay The Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party 1944-48, the PCI was defined as \\'a major instrument of Soviet geopolitical interest\\'.53Accordingtotheauthors,wholargelybased</s><s>their research on the reports sent to Moscow by Kostylev, the Soviet ambassador in Rome, the Italian communist leaders were continuously seeking advice from the Soviets, with whom they had meetings on a regular basis, discussing virtually every aspect of their political activity, including the PCI\\'s economic programme for the reconstruction of the country.Rossi and Zaslavsky concluded that:The documents demonstrate that the degree of Soviet control over the PCI leadership was very high, and undoubtedly higher than previously recognized by historians.All major initiatives on the part of the PCI had to receive Soviet authorization.54Togliatti,\\'amoderateStalinist\\',55committed the leadership of the party to a relentless effort to contain, moderate and eventually halt Italian workers\\' revolutionary spirit, preventing any insurrection in order to meet Stalin\\'s desires.The authors thus endorsed the gauchiste interpretation of the historic function of the PCI within Italian democracy, which had been proposed by Giorgio Galli and, more recently, by Arturo Peregalli.56Thetheory of Togliatti\\'s submissiveness to the Soviets was reiterated in two books published the following year by Aga Rossi: L\\'altra faccia della luna , conference proceedings edited in collaboration with Gaetano Quagliariello, which represented the first attempt to reach a new comparison between the French Communist Party and the PCI, an excellent example of comparative historiography, in the light of the newly available documents;57 andThe declared purpose of the paper by Carlo Spagnolo, comunista intemazionale ,72 as well as of the introduc proceedings by Roberto Gualtieri, Carlo Spagnolo an to divert the focus from the relationship between Togliatti and Moscow, to that between Togliatti and th as a whole.Because Togliatti was one of the most im leaders in the communist world, his political activit mere obedience to his Soviet masters.As far as the by the PCI was concerned, the existence of the partito evidence that the Italian Communist Party had endors racy, at least the Italian

areas in which was a specialist, and also examined the possibilities of neofascism after 1945, as we its relation to Islamism at the end of the twentieth

into the cultural origins of National Socialism.5</s><s>Earlier, in 1961, Fritz Stern had published a study of three leading völkisch ideologues,6 but Mosse\\'s work treated a much broader range of völkisch culture, not merely in print but also in the visual arts, marking a shift in the data and methodology of fascist studies.</s><s>The inaugural number of the Journal of Contemporary History in 1966 was designed to provide a new focus on fascism as a general European phenomenon.</s><s>Since so much attention elsewhere had been devoted to Germany, Nazism was largely excluded from the discussion, which presented only one article on Italy, devoting most of the space to the lesser-known movements.</s><s>Mosse himself began the number with a comparatively short piece on \\'The Genesis of Fascism,\\' which summarized the interpretation of fascist culture and doctrine on which he had been working for the past five years and more.</s><s>He clearly identified the origin of the key ideas of fascism in \\'the attack on positivism and liberalism at the end of the nineteenth century.\\'</s><s>Much of the article was devoted to the fascist search for a new morality, which Mosse emphasized nonetheless meant for society as a whole the return to bourgeois morality.</s><s>This conclusion, which he reiterated again and again in his writings, would be one of the more controversial aspects of his approach.</s><s>It was not inaccurate but might have been clarified by pointing out that all modern revolutionary movements which achieve power end up by promoting a form of traditional morality for society as a whole, since they can find no other basis, in the long run, for structuring a coherent society capable of reproducing itself.</s><s>Left unresolved in this formulation was the issue of a new morality for fascists themselves, and whether the movement\\'s activism and vitalism were simply to be tamed by an authoritarian structure.</s></p><p><s>That, Mosse thought, did not seem to be the case, for fascist vitalism was no merely to be tamed but to be channeled in the service of the nation.</s><s>Missing in this brief discussion, an excellent analytic summary as far as it

a product of the depersonalization and abstract rationalism generated by the Enlightenment,21 but also as a result of the search by some in Western society to achieve order a change.</s><s>He also thought the urge for conformity and \\'respectability\\' had a good deal to do with it.</s><s>The bo primer on the development and growing radicalization link here and elsewhere between the Holocaust

existential compulsion behind his argument, which with regard to the origins of fascism never made much sense, as was pointed out even by leading scholars very sympathetic to his work, such as Emilio

studies as Mosse, and at first approached them rather tangentially through his work on Russia and Germany.</s><s>His book Young Germany: A History of the German Youth Movement (1962) did not discuss

anti-Sovietism.</s><s>Whereas George Mosse\\'s Europe largely ended at the Elbe, Laqueur would eventually pioneer the extension of fascist studies into Russia.</s></p><p><s>His first book on fascism

variants.</s><s>Both claims were obviously valid, up to a point, but, if that were absolutely the case, how might the reader be sure that all these examples belonged to one political genus?</s><s>Thus, as is common in fascist studies (and certainly in the work of Mosse, as well), broad issues of taxonomy were eluded, though many individual problems were discussed.</s></p><p><s>Laqueur took his readers through historical fascism with briskness and precision in a long chapter totaling 90 pages.</s><s>The highlights and conclusions were scarcely unique by that time, though always clear, convincing and well-substantiated.</s><s>Laqueur agreed that fascism was primarily a historical European problem, because only European countries in the interwar era offered the combination of opportunity for mass mobilization together with a major political and cultural crisis and the necessary cultural components.</s><s>He denied that the triumph of fascism was merely due to economic stress, pointing out that the latter was equally or more severe in other countries where fascism did not win out, whereas the trough of the crisis had already passed in both Italy and Germany by the time that the fascists seized power.</s><s>The social basis of fascism was discussed in some detail, together with the similarities to and differences from communism.</s></p><p><s>Laqueur gave fascist doctrine due importance, labeling it \\'nationalist, elitist, and anti-liberal,\\' but differentiating it from the radical right because of its fundamentally revolutionary thrust.</s><s>Racism was seen as an important variable, rather than intrinsic to all fascism.</s><s>He treated key differences between the Italian and German movements, in terms of the importance of the myth of the nation and of the state for the former, and of race for the latter.</s><s>Unlike some, Laqueur warned that not every idea and ingredient found in fascism was wrong just because it was used by fascists, and agreed with his co-editor that fascism was not truly nihilistic, as was so often claimed, but was based on a strongly held belief system and even a kind

in recent years, it has developed into a crucial entry point to the EU Schengen Area.2 Seeking safe passage through Hungary, migrants found themselves in conflict with the EU and its regulations governing mobility.</s><s>The Hungarian Office of Immigration and Nationality (Bevándorlási és Állampolgársági Hivatal, BÁH) designated reception centers (or detention centers) for all migrants who crossed from Serbia to Hungary (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_1\">2</ref>).</s><s>Upon crossing this border and arriving at the closed transit camp in Röszke, the migrants received free tickets to camps around the country: the largest one, in the eastern city of Debrecen; in Bicske, near Budapest; or in Vámosszabadi, by the Slovakian and Austrian borders.</s><s>To reach these destinations, migrants had to change trains in Budapest, but most decided to continue to western Europe rather than travel to the extremely overcrowded camps, where the prospect of quality legal aid is minimal and reception conditions are poor.</s></p><p><s>Migrants bought tickets to cities in Austria and Germany, despite the efforts of the Hungarian staterepresented by the BÁH, the police, and, intriguingly and somewhat worryingly, many humanitarian volunteers focused on organizing people and cajoling them to board trains to refugee camps.</s><s>With some notable exceptions, most migrants were barred from boarding the trains bound for western Europe, and the transit zone around Keleti station heaved with individuals and families who chose to wait for the opportunity to move on.3</s><s>This immobilization often came with a substantial financial loss for migrants, who had spent hundreds of euros on the international train tickets and now found themselves trapped at the passageway underneath the Keleti station with no money, no ID, and no practical possibility of refunds.</s></p><p><s>Once in Hungary, migrants encountered an escalating tension between depoliticizing narratives of crisis and concrete political action that sought to facilitate mobility.</s><s>State agencies and humanitarian volunteer groups framed mobility in terms that emphasized a vertical form of politics, which rests on a series of binaries -notably citizenforeigner and politics-humanitarianism -distinguishing groups to be acted on and the institutions that do the acting.</s><s>We base our understanding of this form of politics on Partha <ref type=\"bibr\">Chatterjee\\'s (2004, 27)</ref> view of political society as a space populated by groups that fall on the wrong side of these binaries.</s><s>These groups are subject to benevolent, paternalistic, or violent action by the state to remedy their situation.</s><s>In the Hungarian government\\'s response to migrants, a rhetoric of \"crisis\" enabled the deployment of a citizen-foreigner binary that legitimized state action against a group that was held in a conceptual and, eventually, material stasis.</s><s>Migrants were immobilized by a discourse that labeled them \"criminals\" and framed them as a threatening group to be dealt with.</s><s>Such framings also The construction of a border fence with neighboring Serbia and Croatia (the border with Slovenia having been effectively closed) was but the most visible of a number of strategies of immobilization that the Hungarian state enacted.</s><s>By the summer\\'s end, however, migrants\\' radical occupation of public space across the country mobilized horizontal solidarities with EU citizens, activist networks, and NGOs, of which we discuss but a few.</s><s>These solidarities, in turn, highlighted slippages between humanitarian and political action and led to the de facto collapse of the Dublin Regulation, the cornerstone of EU asylum legislation, which requires migrants to apply for asylum in the first EU country in which they arrive.5</s></p><p><s>The nature of migrants\\' presence in urban space changed dramatically during the Budapest protests, from seemingly quiescent victims in lune to powerful demonstrators by August.</s><s>By early September, chants echoing the pro-democracy protests in Syria rang out at Budapest\\'s rail station forecourts, evoking jarring connections between these protests and the Arab revolts in the Middle East.6</s></p><p><s>Public parks evolved into hubs of habitation, smuggling, and communicative action: Pope John Paul II Square, a park near Keleti station, soon became informally known as the \"Afghan Park.\"</s><s>Migrant occupation of these and other seemingly neutral nonplaces, such as highways, created spaces where people forged horizontal political solidarities centering on contests over the significance of public space, mobility rights, humanitarian deservingness, and the meanings and scope of volunteer work and activism.</s><s>As the Hungarian government amended asylum legislation to criminalize anyone helping the migrants, horizontal counterpolitics emerged in opposition to the hegemonic verticality of territorial politics.</s><s>Similarly, efforts of immobilization resulted in more radical forms of mobility, such as Hungarian and Austrian citizens smuggling migrants across the border free of charge.</s><s>Under conditions of \"illiberal democracy\" or under \"post-fascism\" (as Hungarian intellectual G. M.</s></p><p><s>Tamas has dubbed the country\\'s regime), migrant protests were transformative.7 Migrants and refugees, horizontally aligned with activist groups, effectively questioned this ordering through protest and disrupted the state\\'s immobilizing strategies through acts of radical mobility that rendered the marginal central and the invisible visible.</s><s>The state\\'s bordering practices, and borders themselves, fabricate the political through processes of marginalization and exclusion wherein a number of groups have at best a tangential relation to the political norm.</s><s>This territorial order, and the bordering practices that it depends on, allows for the production of transit zones, ostensibly neutral spaces conducive to vertical politics.</s><s>Conversely, effective verticality depends on the functional arrangement of the city in terms of vacant zones, places of movement, and sites of leisure, all of which stabilize potentially charged public spaces into a controllable order.</s><s>The analysis of mobility, immobilization, and activism exposes the complex politics of space, place, and voice <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">(Appadurai 1988)</ref>, which came to light through the encounter among migrants, humanitarian volunteers, and the Hungarian state agencies.</s><s>The exclusion of migrants is not a unique or exceptional event: it is linked to other forms of exclusion that became stark when studying how migrants and refugees were governed in the summer of 2015 in Budapest.</s><s>Outlining a border ethnography of mobility and immobilization, we follow the situational radicalism of the migrants\\' agency in an evanescent rebel city, marked by novel political solidarities <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">(Monterescu and Shaindlinger 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As anthropologists living in Budapest, we not only witnessed the events of the summer but also participated in them.8</s><s>It was sometimes difficult to distinguish the role of an activist or an active citizen from the positionality of an anthropologist: the ethnographic skills of interviewing and probing, as well as an intercultural sensitivity and acute awareness of power structures in the humanitarian context, were crucial to our engagement with migrants.</s><s>Our familiarity with Hungarian and European migration policy systems was fundamental in gaining trust and achieving a level of embeddedness that constitutes a prerequisite for ethnography.</s><s>Although we sympathize with recent calls for activist research and engaged ethnography <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">(Hale 2006;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">Low and Merry 2010)</ref>, such an undertaking was not our original intention.</s><s>Our involvement as activists or concerned citizens capable of transporting migrants or writing public commentaries took precedence over ethnographic research; our anthropological sensibilities, however, deeply affected the way we related to the constantly changing events.</s><s>Thus it was partly our own actions as citizens and activists that pointed us to the dialectical relation between immobilization and mobility.</s><s>To address the exigencies of the field, from June to October 2015, we conducted mixed-methods research, practicing daily participant observation in and out of Keleti station, interviewing migrants in transit, and analyzing Hungarian and English-language media sources, official government reports, and social media <ref type=\"bibr\"

focal point of the relational dynamics among the migrants, volunteers and activists, Hungarian government, and the European Union.</s><s>From June onward, a partially sheltered passageway under Keleti turned into a base for hundreds of migrants.</s><s>As the summer reached its end, living conditions deteriorated rapidly.</s><s>Sanitary conditions were abysmal, and the absolute lack of privacy was stressful.</s><s>Kallius, who was involved in a project with a safe house for migrants near the train station, expected it to be rather easy to find people who would like to have a quiet, private place to spend the night.</s><s>She quickly learned, however, that despite the poor living conditions, Keleti\\'s location as a node of mobility was what mattered more for the migrants.</s><s>For the immobilized, all other needs were overshadowed by the hope that Keleti would once again function as an actual train station.</s></p><p><s>Near Keleti, the \"Afghan Park\" underwent the same transition: migrants assessed it according to potential mobility, as a hub where they could meet smugglers heading to western Europe.</s><s>Many migrants chose to sleep there on the cold ground, even in the rain, rather than at a nearby safe house.</s><s>The possibility of meeting smugglers, and therefore of achieving mobility, was the main concern governing how migrants formed their understandings of safety and opportunity.</s><s>What mattered to our interlocutors was not what they had endured during the journey to Budapest, but how the state\\'s vertical strategy of immobilization blocked them from moving onward.</s><s>As Kallius learned to recognize the smuggling hot spots and saw how price fluctuations corresponded to EU migration policy, new people kept arriving, resulting in about 1,000 to 1,500 migrants sleeping in and around Keleti by August.</s></p><p><s>Later that month, a tragedy led refugees to stage protests at the Budapest Keleti train station, protests that, together with Germany\\'s announcement that it would not apply the Dublin Regulation to Syrians, finally led to the opening of the Hungarian-Austrian border and the collapse of the Hungarian asylum system.</s><s>On August 27, 2015, a truck was discovered in Austria with 71 dead migrants inside.</s><s>The migrants had embarked on the fatal journey from Budapest; unable to board international trains, they turned to smugglers and died of suffocation.</s><s>The next day, Migszol Csoport (Migrant Solidarity Group), a small Budapest-based activist organization, held a candlelight vigil at the Keleti train station\\'s main entrance.9</s><s>The group prepared a single banner that stated \"Europe: your hand is covered with blood\" (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_2\">3</ref>), and they demanded that refugees be allowed to board trains.</s><s>A few hundred Hungarians lit candles in silence, while Migszol members toured the passageway underneath the station, informing migrants stranded at the station of the vigil upstairs.</s></p><p><s>As the crowd thinned out and the vigil reached the time of its official end, a large group of migrants, mostly from Pakistan, came up from the station\\'s downstairs passageway and joined the vigil.</s><s>Many of them had just heard of the tragedy.</s><s>The Muslim migrants started to pray and lifted the activists\\' banner, chanting slogans in Pashto and Urdu.</s><s>Passersby and volunteers alike were astounded at the transformation: the migrants had until then stayed in the passageway, which was quite crowded (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\">4</ref>).</s><s>By remaining there, they seemed to be, for many humanitarian volunteers, a faceless mass of people in distress; as they emerged from below, a volunteer for a humanitarian group nervously called for a translator to make sure everything was under control.</s><s>The act of praying at one of the city\\'s key sites broke down the depiction of refugees as depoliticized victims requiring others to act on their behalf.</s><s>This collective performance allowed migrants to claim historical agency and narrative authority beyond their previous position as \"universal humanitarian subject\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Malkki 1996, 377)</ref>.</s><s>Ultimately, it turned out to be the event that led to a series of daily escalating protests and to the march itself.</s></p><p><s>From rolling protests to the march for the border Daily protests began the day after the vigil.</s><s>Several migrants, mostly men from different backgrounds, staged a sit-in at the train station entrance, a scene of a weeklong impasse between migrants protesting their immobilization.</s><s>Migration Aid, a Hungarian humanitarian group, had called for a large protest against the government\\'s brutal migration policies to be held on September 2. 10 As an activist who had spent most of her evenings at Keleti, Kallius was of two minds

there were a few hundred migrants who planned to start marching the next morning.12</s><s>That night, this group of Syrians, who would eventually be joined by Afghans, Pakistanis, and Iraqis, were driven by extreme forms of immobilization to adopt a technique that was revolutionary in its simplicity: walking to Austria.</s></p><p><s>On September 4, migrants took matters into their own hands and began marching in their thousands from Keleti toward the highway to Vienna in the March of Hope (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\">6</ref>).</s><s>The march ended in complete exhaustionseveral migrants

response, and the march itself came to symbolize the \"European refugee crisis\" and the triadic relationship among the state, Migration Aid, and Migszol, as well as to heighten the contrast between the vertical politics of the state and humanitarian groups and the horizontal modus operandi of Migszol.</s></p><p><s>In the meantime, the situation also escalated in Budapest.</s><s>Police were called in to protect migrants from football hooligans after a Hungary-Romania match in a stadium near Keleti; indeed, some of the hooligans hurled firecrackers at the migrants.</s><s>At this point, when tensions at Keleti peaked and the living conditions at the station had become truly unbearable, the Hungarian government made a decision that would have long-lasting consequences: to completely disregard EU legislation, open the border to Austria, and provide buses to transport migrants from Keleti and the march to the Austrian border.</s></p><p><s>The exhausted migrants, volunteers, activists, and journalists alike greeted the arrival of some 90 public buses with a mixture of disbelief, relief, and suspicion.</s><s>Migrants refused to board the buses unless journalists were allowed to join.</s><s>Migrants staying at the various camps around the country quickly proceeded to leave as well, walking many kilometers along several highways to border-town train stations.</s><s>Over the course of the weekend, the transit zones in Budapest, as well as the camps in Bicske and Debrecen, went from dramatically overcrowded to almost empty.</s><s>An Austrian convoy of private citizens arrived in Budapest the following day and transported many migrants who had been unable to board the buses.</s><s>The double standard in law enforcement became obvious when the authorities ignored the Austrian convoy by targeting Hungarian citizens -also transporting migrants -as smugglers, resulting in much more publicity for the Austrian effort than for the Hungarian.</s><s>The movement of incoming and outgoing people lasted intermittently until September 15, with the final closure of the Serbian border made infamous in global media when police brutally

abiding difference remains in the explicit focus of each group.</s><s>Migszol is a very small, explicitly horizontal group; its politics remain entwined with and formed in consultation with migrants, and the group\\'s key claim is that the humanitarian crisis needs a political solution.</s><s>Migration Aid, in contrast, is a very large, highly specialized humanitarian organization mobilized by the \"crisis\" and propelled by a vertical account of charity and politics.</s><s>In addition, the latter was much more visible during the summer.</s><s>While Migszol is adamant about remaining an informal, unregistered collective, in the aftermath of the summer events and to the disappointment of some humanitarian volunteers, Migration Aid registered as an NGO and embarked on international

\"crisis\" discourse led to highly specialized forms of humanitarianism that at times appeared incongruous in the Hungarian context.</s><s>The mass mobilization of humanitarian aid largely targeted a specific group of people -ignoring, explicitly or implicitly, the indigenous poor.</s><s>Because Keleti station is located at the center of a particularly deprived area, this omission was more obvious: the sudden humanitarian outpouring directed at newcomers highlighted both the starkness of indigenous poverty and marginalization in Budapest and the exclusionary effect of the discourse on deservingness.</s></p><p><s>The refusal to distribute humanitarian largesse to other marginalized groups exposes deep divisions in Hungarian civil society.</s><s>Migszol, echoing some other Hungarian

providing social services should then be qualified: the volunteers replaced the state only during a perceived crisis, and only those in transit were considered eligible.</s><s>Thus, paradoxically, rather than challenging notions of belonging through inclusionary \"acts of citizenship\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b15\">(Isin and Nielsen 2007)</ref>, humanitarian volunteers targeted nonnationals as the primary subject of intervention in a way that foreclosed their agency.</s></p><p><s>Most Hungarians assume that all refugees are in transit, but they also understand and support refugees\\' plans to leave the country and thus support the state\\'s vertical logic.</s><s>Recent Hungarian policy, media, and political rhetoric has focused on the emigration of young Hungarians to western Europe in search of employment and a better life, and also on the deep-seated fear of being invaded by non-Hungarian (read non-Christian) Others.</s><s>On a practical level, this assumption of refugees\\' mobility halts energy and resources from being used on integration schemes; on an analytic level, it reveals thought-provoking parallels between Hungarians\\' and migrants\\' positioning toward western Europe, both seeking a better life.</s><s>In the words of Dace Dzenovska, this assumed Other is \"svoi\" (one of us) -a sociality of \"people who recognised each other as fellow travellers from across the lines of state-based power\" (2014, 278).</s><s>These parallels call attention to analyses of border regimes that do not overemphasize depictions of \"Fortress Europe\" and

Hungarian Jews are largely assimilated and relatively well off, their liminal position between citizenship and religion tended to yield an ambivalent response to the refugee crisis, which divided the

Holocaust.\"15</s><s>Overwhelmingly opposing the government, the younger generation exhibits a remarkable commitment to what they consider Jewish and European values of social justice.</s><s>With initiatives like Aurora, an alternative cultural center, young Hungarian Jews read the refugee issue in light of the Jewish history of expulsion under the slogan No One Is Illegal.16</s><s>Nonetheless, the principled coalition between Aurora and Migszol does not preclude a profound ambivalence among most liberal Jews.</s><s>One interlocutor, who volunteered to drive four Syrian migrants to the Austrian border (see Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_5\">8</ref>), concluded the trip with a confession that she was Jewish and urged them to \"not hate

organisation committed to the sublation (in the Hegelian sense of auflieben) of the avant-garde tradition, of 1950s anti-Stalinist Marxism and of the bohemian ethos of the early 1950s Parisian juvenile culture of the Left Bank.</s><s>Jörn introduced the Spur group to the Situationists, and initially acted as a mentor to the Spur artists.</s><s>In 1958-1959, Prem, Sturm, Hans-Peter Zimmer, and Fisher knew very litde about the organisation and its principles, but their membership presented advantages for all parties involved.</s><s>While Guy Debord, the Si\\'s unofficial leader, was keen to extend the organisation\\'s presence to the German-speaking world, Jörn wished to rely on a stronger nucleus of artists within the organisation.</s><s>For their part, Spur members saw a relationship with the SI as a vital link which would both cement their relationship with Jörn and widen their acquaintances in the rest of Western Europe.</s><s>Spur artists, with the exception of Fischer, officially joined the SI in the spring of 1959.</s><s>Under Jörn \\'s guidance, Spur artists began to challenge the traditional boundaries of the aesthetic, a tradition in which they were imbued as former students of the Munich Akademie der Bildenden Künste.</s><s>In the winter of 1958-1959, Spur members performed provocative actions, such as throwing their first manifesto from the tower of St. Peter\\'s Church in Munich.</s><s>Shortly thereafter, the group began the publication of a magazine, called Spur , which ran for seven issues between 1960 and 1961 and became one of the main outlets for the artists\\' provocations.</s></p><p><s>Spur addressed its public through a defiant rhetoric of bravado and sarcasm; as The Spur Group, Détournement and the Politics of Time century avant-gardes.</s><s>This broad phenomenon has been the subject of insightful debates; however, these analyses occasionally fail to consider the local specificities of re-enacting avant-garde strategies.</s><s>The analysis of Spur s engagement with time through détournement requires a brief examination of the hegemonic temporalities informing the later years of the Adenauer Era.</s><s>The affinities between the temporality that was put forward by numerous avant-garde movements and that informing prevalent discourses in late 1 950s West Germany will introduce Spur\\'s alternative approach to time.</s></p><p><s>In his 1962 book Theory of the Avant-garde , Renato Poggioli acknowledged the paradoxical temporality of Futurism and several avant-garde movements.</s><s>These not only claimed to be the foremost interpreters of their own time but they also professed to prefigure what was yet to occur, therefore placing their actions outside and ahead of the present. 1 1 Yet, Poggioli conceded, this ambivalent position infused avant-garde artists with the necessary positive impulse.</s><s>In the same year as the publication of Poggioli\\'s book, a German theorist and writer published an essay setting forth an opposing argument.</s><s>In \\'The Aporias of the Avant-garde\\', Hans Magnus Enzensberger observed that the notion of the avant-garde carried with it an unusable temporality.12</s><s>The term, he noted, initially described the units located at the front of a military action, thus a spatial position, but when it entered the cultural -artistic context, its spatial implications became temporal ones.</s><s>This shift was premised on the idea that human history follows predictable stages towards increasing progress, unfolding a master narrative that philosopher Karl Löwith had defined as the \\'secularised version of eschatological time\\'.13</s><s>Enzensberger criticised the vanguardist cult of the \\'work in progress\\', as its rhetoric misleadingly presupposed an accumulation of knowledge that would come to fruition in the near future.</s><s>According to the writer, the avant-garde\\'s temporality was dangerously akin to that of capitalism.</s><s>While attempting to actualise the future, avant-garde movements reiterated the diachronia of the market in its incessant promotion of new commodities and needs.</s><s>Ultimately, the avant-gardes advocated a temporal regime characterised by compulsive newness, which is the cipher of capitalism.</s></p><p><s>It is not surprising that a West German commentator such as Enzensberger highlighted the contentious temporality of the avant-garde in 1962.</s><s>In 1950s West Germany, two prominent collective temporalities, the economic and the political, shared with the avant-garde\\'s temporality the same thrust towards the future.</s><s>The latter part of the Adenauer Era witnessed a Wirtschaftswunder (economic miracle), a steady growth of the gross domestic product and an unprecedented rise in the standards of living.</s><s>West Germany was quickly evolving into a consumption-oriented economy.</s><s>This prosperity was heavily dependent on mass production, whose correlate, the extremely rapid obsolescence of goods, laid bare one of the most ruthless and accelerated versions of capitalist temporality.</s><s>Meanwhile, the consumerist frenzy was accompanied by the downplaying of the Nazi past in the name of normalisation.</s><s>The post-war years were not a time of generalised amnesia, but rather selective memory.14</s><s>There was a tendency, which was championed by the government through the 1950s amnesties, to identify the Nazi perpetrators with the twenty-four war criminals who were tried in Nuremberg in 1945-1946.</s><s>This self-indulgence was as much political as it was pragmatic.</s><s>The resurrection of the nation\\'s identity also required the effort of former Nazi sympathisers, not least because the trials against former perpetrators raised complex legal issues.15</s><s>It was unclear whether it would be possible to prosecute acts committed while in the employ of recognised authorities.</s><s>In addition, the opaque proceduralism governing the Nazi war machine made individual responsibility difficult to determine.</s><s>Numerous civil servants Akademie der Bildenden Künste.</s><s>To this end, they adopted the intimidating tone of avant-garde phraseology and complied with its temporality.</s><s>In their first manifesto, which was written in November 1958, the Spur artists satirised their detractors as backward and adopted a messianic tone, defining themselves as \\'painters of the future\\'.18</s><s>On the other hand, they were wary of this facile optimism.</s><s>In issue 2 of their magazine, the Spur artists provided a revealing illustration of their doubts.</s><s>The drawing (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">2</ref>) presents the seamless path of progress.</s></p><p><s>Although the character says, among other things, \\'time works for us\\', the image complicates this self-confidence, suggesting both that the future (Zukunft) has not begun, and that the human being approaching it is naked and turned back towards the past.</s><s>The work implies a problematic relationship with time, repudiating the economic miracle\\'s correlation between novelty and amelioration.</s><s>In a contemporary text, the Spur group explicitly rejected this equivalence:</s></p><p><s>Avant-gardism made into a matter of principle dissipates in conformism.</s><s>[. .</s><s>.]</s><s>This reduces the avant-garde to being an instrument of a stupid, externalised movement of progress.</s><s>A revolutionary artistic movement in our sense is aimed against the avantgardism of today\\'s society.19</s></p><p><s>In his diary, Prem reiterated this argument, tackling the latent affinities between the dominant discourses of the society with which the group grappled and the creed of \\'progress\\' preached by many avant-garde artists:</s></p><p><s>The \\'conformists\\' [. .</s><s>.] admire whatever is progressive (and in this they are like the avantgardists), they love affluence [. .</s><s>.].</s><s>They pursue appearance.</s><s>It is rare to find someone who is a hundred percent like that, but in each of us there is a bit of it.</s><s>When taken together we are like that, and we want to be so.20</s></p><p><s>The prognoses of Debord were pivotal in this sarcastic critique of \\'avantgardists\\'.</s><s>According to him, the society of spectacle tended to co-opt vanguard  This accounts for the ambivalence of the manifesto Spur issued in January 1961, which was titled Avant-garde is undesirable /24 On one level, the text declared the bankruptcy of the avant-garde, but, on another level, it posited a residual potential for the SI.</s><s>In their magazine, Spur dramatised this tension through an image (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\">3</ref>) that altered Pieter Brueghel the Elder\\'s The Strife of Lent with Shrovetide.</s><s>The inscription, oder umgekehrt (or the other way round), expressed the group\\'s misgivings about the relationship between society (Gesellschaft) and Spur, with the group caught in a trap, between the role of opponent to the smug display of abundance and that of \\'fresh meat\\'; that is, the new goods and markets capitalism constantly seeks.</s><s>Yet, a further aspect warrants a closer look: Spur\\'s choice of Pieter Brueghel itself.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Forging Alternative Temporalities</head><p><s>In late

and some collages will illuminate the way in which the group summoned up both the recent and remote past.</s><s>The following analysis will articulate three interrelated themes: détournements focusing on the Nazi past, those concentrating on the notion of history, and détournements revolving around the identity of the group.</s><s>The Freudian category of Fehlleistung , literally meaning \\'faulty performance\\' but generally translated as \\'Freudian slip\\', along with the concept of détournement , will guide the investigation through Spur\\'s deconstruction of late 1950s \\'chrononormativity\\'.28</s></p><p><s>Spur\\'s action mentioned at the opening of this article needs to be contextualised within another performance that was enacted by HAP Grieshaber, a left-wing artist and art professor at the Karlsruhe Art Academy, who had been banned from his profession from 1933 to 1945.</s><s>The Munich Haus der Deutschen Kunst (House of German Art) was built by the Nazis and became one of the most prominent National Socialist museums.</s><s>Following its reconstruction after the War, the nationalistic nuances of its original name were whitewashed and the museum was renamed Haus der Kunst (House of Art).</s><s>At the opening of the Haus der Kunst exhibition organised by the Deutsche Künstlerbund in October 1960, Grieshaber distributed flyers and pasted up posters containing excerpts from Adolf Hitler\\'s speech at the inauguration of the Haus der Deutschen Kunst.</s><s>His protest stemmed from the fact that the Karlsruhe Art Academy\\'s examining committee refused to review the work of two of his students, as it lacked any identifiable subject matter.29 Grieshaber resigned from his position, outraged by the committee\\'s blind observance of a statute dating from 1940.</s></p><p><s>Grieshaber\\'s action took place a few months after a wave of anti-Semitic graffiti, which the Adenauer administration erroneously feared was a part of a defamatory campaign orchestrated in East Berlin.30</s><s>In such a climate, Grieshaber was immediately arrested and accused of propagating Nazi ideas.</s><s>This travesty of justice becomes even more glaring when one notes that at the exhibition opening the Bavarian Culture Minister, Theodor Maunz, delivered a speech announcing that, \\'Art in Germany is again free, and thanks to ethical norms that are counted on in Western democracies, no \"degenerate\" artists would be summoned by the police.</s><s>The freedom of culture is secured through the Constitution!\\'31</s><s>In 1964, it was revealed that Theodor Maunz had actively contributed to the formulation of the Racial Laws of 1938.</s><s>Maunz was then forced to resign.</s><s>Following his death in 1993, it was also proven that he maintained contacts with neo-Nazi groups throughout the post-war years.</s></p><p><s>Spur\\'s intervention took place a few days after Grieshaber\\'s action.</s><s>Read by Sturm within the framework of a television report of the exhibition, the text indirectly targeted Maunz \\'s speech, contending that the State and the Church repressed the freedom of artists, viewing them as \\'degenerate, pathological and criminal\\'.32</s><s>Spur\\'s performance can be interpreted as a détournement , insofar as Hitler\\'s oratorical style served as an appeal to freedom.</s><s>And yet, a praise of freedom uttered in a Hitlerian tone could but be disconcerting.</s><s>The clash between the literal meaning of the text and Sturm\\'s purposefully \\'faulty\\' performance created a gap which can be elucidated using the Freudian concept of Fehlleistung , and particularly what Freud called Verlesen , meaning \\'faulty reading\\' .</s><s>In Psychopathology of Every day Life (1901), Freud argues that some slips are not accidental; they hide repressed impulses and traumatic memories.</s><s>The Spur Group, Détournement and the Politics of Time</s></p><p><s>The text claimed that artists underwent torture and experienced the horrors of the concentration camp.</s><s>This was not mere paranoia.</s><s>ť Today artists are persecuted with invisible needles, i.e., arguments whispered to

imperatives of 1950s society.38</s><s>This analysis is correct, but underestimates Spur\\'s proclivity for bluffing and the displacement of identities.</s><s>Issue 4 dramatises the figure of the artist as a scapegoat, but the delirium of persecution adumbrates a challenge to 1950s society\\'s \\'inability to mourn\\' and a call to learn from what occurred during the Nazi years.39</s><s>It is hard to believe that Spur members assimilated their predicament to that experienced by concentration camps inmates.</s><s>Spur members repeatedly exposed the double-edged relationship between capitalist society and avant-garde art; posing as martyrs would have been contradictory.</s><s>The comparison made by the group did not imply an identification with the victims of the Holocaust, as Diederichsen suggests.</s><s>The crucial argument of the issue is that, if the Nazis found their interior enemy in the Jew, the leftist, the \\'anti-social,\\' and the homosexual, 195 O\\'s Bavarian society found its interior enemy in the nonconformist artist, hailed as the incarnation of unproductive labour.</s><s>Spur artists did not indulge in the comfortable role of innocent victims.</s><s>Rather, they highlighted the persistent dynamics of exclusion and the obsessions of late 1 950\\'s Bavarian society.</s><s>Conclusive evidence for this reading can be found in Spur\\'s arguments during the trial, which began in 1962.</s><s>The members of the group wrote a collective reply to the court, declaring their exasperation and casting Spur as a projection screen, stating that \\'we also resolutely refuse to serve as a screen for the projections of all those unable to revolt for themselves, those who need objects in order to displace onto us the negativity latent in themselves\".40</s><s>Spur\\'s unsettling resurrection of memories can be associated with what Quinn Slobodian has defined as the \\'activist memory\\' of the West German New Left.41</s><s>The New Left\\'s political use of the Holocaust has often been criticised.</s><s>Slobodian has challenged these accusations and illuminated how, in the late 1950s, young leftists developed a new approach to the policies of memory, one that was directed not only against the \\'amnesia of the fathers\\', but also against the sanitised and elegiac ways in which the Holocaust was recalled.</s><s>Couched in the rhetoric of the \\'unfortunate recent past\\' , the condemnation of Nazi crimes was perceived by some leftists as just another strategy to deflect attention from the massacres taking place in the present.</s><s>By contrast, \\'activist memory\\', which resulted in shocking photographic books such as The Yellow Star (first published in Germany in 1960), \\'contained an injunction not only to remember but also to act [. .</s><s>.] turning the impulse of the memory of the National Socialism to present injustices\\' .</s></p><p><s>Issue number 4 of Spur\\'s magazine constitutes an early instance of \\'activist memory\\' .</s><s>This is substantiated by a collage located on the same page as the text about the persecution of artists.</s><s>The work dredged up the memory of Nazi atrocities, but only to suggest that what Spur saw as a key drive and forma mentis in the advent of Nazism was still very much present (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_5\">4</ref>).</s><s>In this image, Spur members incorporated the fragment of a photo of a concentration camp shortly after the liberation, in which the former guards of the camp carry carts filled with emaciated corpses.</s><s>In the background, Spur drew grotesque humanoids, and pasted reproductions of naked human figures.</s><s>On the men\\'s armbands Spur artists wrote the word \\'Konformist\\' , establishing a parallel between the conservatism of 1950s Bavarian society and the mindset the group deemed  \\'Spur-Historie\\' can be categorised as a détournement because its content resignifies the implications of its typeface.</s><s>Unlike Spur\\'s détournement of Hitler\\'s speeches and Bense\\'s intellectual jargon, this work is closer in spirit to some of Debord\\'s détournements , particularly his full-length films, which often relied upon material culled from popular Hollywood films.</s><s>These were charged with what Debord tended to see as an originally positive valence.49</s><s>As argued by Jacques Rancière, the chief purposes of some of Debord\\'s détournement emerge more clearly through a comparison with the notion of Verfremdungseffekt (distancing effect).50</s><s>Although its output may at times resemble that generated by Bertolt Brecht \\'s Verfremdungseffekt , détournement does not pursue the goal of rupturing the identification of the audience with the hero in order to stimulate a critical reflection on social reality.</s><s>In some of Debord\\'s films, détournement is not so much about de -familiarising as it is about encouraging identification with the hero, but only once the hero is freed from the racist, nationalist, and conservative distortions with which he or she is imbued.</s><s>In several Debord\\'s films and comic strips for the Si\\'s magazine, détournement looks to reveal both the legitimate aspirations of the masses, best exemplified by contemporary popular culture, and the way in which the masses\\' investment is recuperated by capitalist society to its own advantage.</s><s>Spur\\'s détournement of a gothic typeface functions in a similar fashion.</s><s>Through its charming squiggles and anti-utilitarian ethos, Tiemann-Gotisch can be construed as signifying a romantic longing for a medieval plenitude before the putative fragmentation engendered by capitalism.</s></p><p><s>But the Spur group\\'s text had no nostalgic implications and did not proffer a compensatory re-enchantment of the world.</s><s>\\'Spur-Historie\\' stages the attempt to reclaim the quest for freedom and un-alienated work, immanent in the typeface, from the nationalist nuances within which it was often framed.</s><s>The text did not foster escapist fantasies about völkisch revivals or a \\'conservative revolution\\' as defined in Peter Osborne\\'s The Politics of Time.51</s><s>Instead, it sought to unveil the ambitions of abundance and fulfilment beyond capitalism that informed some aspects of Romanticism.</s></p><p><s>Spur members conflated various strands of libertarian Marxism and anarchist individualism.</s><s>Nonetheless, they defined themselves as \\'revolutionary romantics\\' in the text they authored for their first group exhibition at the van   \\'Spur-Historie \"s tension between subject matter and form calls forth the slips made while writing, which are defined as Verschreiben in Freud\\'s theories.</s><s>Spur members purposefully selected a \\'faulty\\', equivocal typeface in order to exhume the emancipatory potential of elements of German history and, simultaneously, to enact their positive persistence in the Adenauer Era.</s><s>But a Gothic typeface ( Fraktur in German) could be used as a mnemonic device to resuscitate antithetical strands of thought.</s><s>Spur appropriated Fraktur to evoke the Nazi past in a 1959 flyer issued after the Si\\'s conference in Munich.</s><s>Some of the flyer\\'s text (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_6\">8</ref>) was written in a Gothic script; this included the title, Ein kultureller Putsch (A cultural putsch), which referenced Hitler\\'s Munich Putsch of 1923.</s><s>This choice was a testament to the group\\'s accurate use of typefaces; for the flyer Spur did not select the seraphic Tiemann-Gotisch , but rather the Weiß-Gotisch, the much colder script created in 1936, which acted as a reminder of the support Hitler had enjoyed in Munich thirty-six years earlier.</s></p><p><s>It is however necessary to return to \\'Spur-Historie\\', as the writing did not only archive a trauma and hidden potential, but it also defied the notion of history inherited from the nineteenth century.</s></p><p><s>\\'Spur-Historie\\' outlines the history of the group, but does so by merging important events with anecdotes, true facts and fictional stories, reasonable causal relations, and deliberately absurd statements.</s><s>The text is not organised chronologically and avoids any sense of evolution often impinging upon biographical narratives.</s><s>At the end of the text, a sentence provides an opportunity to understand its rationale: \\'In this story [Historie], we could not mention all of the people, as only the future will show which ones were important in the past\\' .</s><s>This seems a rational assumption, but it is placed as the final word of a text that brings this assumption to its logical, if absurd, conclusion.</s><s>If only the future will determine the conspicuous aspects of the present, why should one provide a hierarchy in a biography and set basic conditions to make sense of it?</s><s>Spur pretends to surrender to the chaos of lived experience, leaving the judgment of its activity to the future.</s><s>This apparently nihilistic, but fundamentally sardonic, approach to history should be placed against the historical thought of one of the most prominent public intellectuals of the Adenauer Era, philosopher Karl Jaspers.</s><s>It is known that Spur members read some of his books.</s><s>Prem criticised Jaspers in his diary, and in a 1959 diary entry Zimmer mentioned that he was reading Jaspers.</s><s>In particular, \\'Spur- (world history).</s><s>The philosopher saw history as a complex but meaningful path, whose salient tendencies and setbacks, but ultimately growing fulfilment, can be understood by a learned individual, thus positing for himself a transcendental position outside of history.</s><s>With its disintegration of linear narrative, \\'Spur-Historie\\' mocks this reassuring and highly selective account postulating immanent progress in history.</s><s>The group reiterated its satire in its magazine, sketching a derisory history of human culture (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_8\">9</ref>) .</s><s>The drawing traced the first stages (\\'Magic\\', \\'Myth\\', and \\'Religion\\'), then its \\'transitory phase\\', symbolised by the odd pairing of Bense and Marilyn Monroe, and finally its supreme accomplishment: \\'Situationist culture\\'.</s><s>The arbitrariness of Jaspers \\'s and similar genealogies, not to mention their underlying consonance with theology, was ironically turned into the triumph of Spur\\'s peers.</s></p><p><s>The term Historie can be understood as an old-fashioned synonym of Geschichte , which is the most common German word for \\'History\\'.</s><s>The title of the draft of \\'Spur-Historie\\' reads Spur-Geschichte , but Geschichte is struck through with a line, which leads to the hypothesis that the final choice of the word Historie was the result of careful consideration.57</s><s>It is possible to speculate about this erasure.</s><s>In the 1970s, historian Reinard Koselleck demonstrated that the current concept of Geschichte is recent.</s><s>Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, Koselleck argued, the term Historie specifically indicated a written account of past events.</s><s>By contrast, past events in themselves were defined as Geschichte , which was used as a plural noun.</s><s>However, with the advent of the idea that history was not only a series of past events, but rather a metaphysical entity linking the past to the future and inducing progress, the word Geschichte supplanted the word Historie and came to signify both the chronicle of past  Spur addressed the prevalent collective temporalities and the persistence of the Nazi ideology in 1950s society.</s><s>However, it did not locate itself outside of time.</s><s>As ť Spur-Historie\\' suggests, the group also focused on its own temporality.</s><s>This is apparent in a drawing made by Zimmer and published in the group\\'s magazine (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_10\">10</ref>).</s><s>This work combined several ways of depicting history.</s><s>The trajectory of the spiral expands as it approaches the present, hinting at the idea of progress.</s><s>The circle evokes both a temporality anchored in the cycles of nature, and the cyclical, if deceptive, newness imposed by the capitalist accumulation, as maintained by Walter Benjamin in his Arcades Project, and Enzensberger after him.</s><s>However, Spur\\'s spiral has a distinctive property: it shows its previous states.</s><s>Thus, Spur\\'s spiral curve provides a visual rendering of stored time, advocating the need to historicise and memorialise.</s><s>In the spiral, \\'Beckmann\\' and the Brücke (in the top right corner) participate in contemporary history just as much as the Iron Curtain (on the left side of the image), \\'Dada,\\' \\'Pollock\\', Barock, and Gotik.</s><s>While discarding the idea of anachronism, Spur shows that deferrals, replications and survivals punctuate the history of images, to the point that some artistic movements have not come to pass and still live on through Spur.</s></p><p><s>The strategies of memorialisation put forward by both \\'Spur Historie\\' and Zimmer \\'s spiral are analogous to those of Mémoires, as interpreted by Frances Stracey.59</s><s>Assembled by Jörn and Debord in 1957, Mémoires is a book about the functioning of remembrance that revolves around the bohemian lives of Debord and his peers in the early 1950s.</s><s>Despite its theme, no traces of complacency or self-heroisation are evident in the publication.</s><s>As Stracey has shown, the \\'collaged mementos\\' of Mémoires push the \\'the reader [. .</s><s>.] to stray, to dérive, even to get lost, as in the end, the assurance of narrative closure is denied\\'.60</s><s>Similar to Spur\\'s amalgamation of different temporal layers, Mémoires guides the reader through a story that remains a chaotic and open-ended event necessitating reactivation and appropriation, rather than veneration.</s><s>According to Stracey, Debord\\'s and Jörn \\'s joint work materialises a \\'liquid\\' model of history and archive that eludes the spectacularisation of memories, while simultaneously ensuring historical survival.</s></p><p><s>In issue 4 of the magazine, Spur further explored the issue of selfmemorialisation and the threats to which it is exposed.</s><s>The group adopted détournement to depict its temporal identity, but it did so by parodying the effusive rhetoric of family albums and postcards.</s><s>In Spur\\'s work, the latter often</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"

This is cloning and storage of human cells in exactly the same way that cloning and storage of human embryos is. In many ways they are separated by a distinction without a difference and I would not like to be the person that had to tell a seriously, or even terminally, ill individual that it is not possible to treat them because the only way is to produce immunologically sound material which they will not reject by cloning – and that this is not allowed. It was decided on 15 November 2001 that cloning of embryos for therapeutic research should no longer be licensed, but cloning one for birth apparently is and there are medical practitioners who seem to think that this is a good and practical idea. It is suspected that the incredibly high failure rate of cloned foetuses will mitigate against pursuing human clones. To put numbers on this, of 277 attempts only one sheep, Dolly, was born and further successful examples of animal cloning have been just as hard won. However, failure in this context is not a simple, clear, non-viable embryo; it includes gross malformations and developmental problems. These would not be an acceptable outcome in human cloning. This problem of not thinking about questions on a ‘what if?’ basis before the practical necessity arises is exactly the same situation that seems to have occurred with DNA proﬁling and genetic testing for disease genes. We have simply not been ready as a society to address questions that are going to have profound effects for future generations. This, sadly, is a general failing. Statements such as ‘think of the children’, have very little power to motivate; what does motivate seems to be political will and commerce. It is true, as discussed earlier, that large numbers are not easily conceived of. What is also true is that long periods of time are not easily comprehended either. So, to take an example from a different science, but one which is very real now and can therefore give us pointers to the future of our ethical problems in genetics, let us consider the question of nuclear waste. We can visualise this not just as a physical problem but an ethical one which is dependent upon society and the good will of society as well. The long term control of nuclear waste is a problem. No matter how it is stored or dealt with it needs to be looked after for a very long time. Given the half-life of some of this material – that is the length of time it takes to reduce its radioactivity by half – the storage times are prodigiously long. It is not unrealistic to say that storage should be in excess of 10,000 years, but no civilisation has been around that long and it would require a great leap of faith to suggest that the current nuclear powers would remain intact, politically stable and ﬁnancially able to look after such a potential problem for so long. It is to be hoped that humanity is going to out-last nuclear waste, but the questions regarding political stability remain. We simply do not know what sort of a government we will have 1,000 years hence; we do not know what sort of data they will hold about our genes, so now is the time to question their perceived right to hold such information. Now is the time to challenge the perceived right of testers to take samples to ﬁnd out whatever they like about an individual and possibly pass it on.</title>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Joe</forename><surname>Kincheloe</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Shirley</forename><surname>Steinberg</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Patricia</forename><surname>Hinchey</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Joe</forename><surname>Kincheloe</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Shirley</forename><surname>Steinberg</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t\\t<idno type=\"DOI\">10.4324/9781843146995-20</idno>\\n\\t\\t<ptr target=\"https://about.jstor.org/terms\" />\\n\\t</analytic>\\n\\t<monogr>\\n\\t\\t<title level=\"m\">Genetics and DNA Technology: Legal Aspects</title>\\n\\t\\t<imprint>\\n\\t\\t\\t<publisher>Routledge-Cavendish</publisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t<date type=\"published\" when=\"1999\">1999. 2008. 2004. 1999. 2005</date>\\n\\t\\t\\t<biblScope unit=\"page\" from=\"112\" to=\"112\" />\\n\\t\\t</imprint>\\n\\t</monogr>\\n\\t<note>Developmental psychology has historically been -according to these scholars -a form of controlling children and &quot;normalizing&quot; them.

up issues of German society in the postwar period, including the allied occupation, politics of the early adenauer era, and the legacies of the Nazi past in postwar society.</s><s>it is less commonly known that koeppen had a sustained interest in film, that he made a living during the Second World War writing for the film industry, and that he wrote a screenplay after the war entitled Bei Betty.</s><s>Unlike his postwar modernist novels, which combine stream of consciousness, literary montage, and multiple perspectives, the Bei Betty manuscript (ca.</s><s>1946-48)  represents an experiment with a popular genre and medium-it is a crime story written for the screen. 1 this mystery, set in the ruins of an unnamed city, begins with the murder of Günter halben, and an extended flashback reveals the story of father and daughter, Günter and elisabeth halben, refugees from the east who struggle to come to terms with the defeat of National Socialism and a new postwar order.</s><s>as a former Nazi Party member halben cannot find work until he meets Betty and is drawn into the Berlin black market scene with its mix of dubious characters.</s><s>the end of the film reveals the puzzling fact that halben\\'s daughter elisabeth was the culprit.</s><s>although Bei Betty was never produced as a film, this essay situates the script as a key part of koeppen\\'s oeuvre and as a crucial artifact of postwar German culture that helps us understand the emerging corpus of Trümmerfilme as well as the complexity of denazification.</s><s>the Bei Betty screenplay highlights the ambivalence of the Wiederaufbau as both reality and illusion-exposing the theatrical nature of the quick reconstruction of German cities, which generated set-like façades that concealed the underlying rubble.</s><s>in my analysis, i demonstrate how koeppen\\'s work from this period links physical reconstruction with acts of selfrefashioning in the aftermath of the war, highlighting the political and social stakes of performing a new self in response to the allied occupation.</s><s>Ultimately, koeppen\\'s screenplay reveals the \"front\" and \"backstage\" mentality that shaped private and public life during the postwar interregnum, especially as German citizens were scrutinized by the allies as part of a larger societal denazification.</s></p><p><s>in general, koeppen\\'s film projects have received relatively little attention, although the author\\'s multimediality and his interest in radio, cinema, and television 37</s></p></div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</abstract>\\n\\t\\t</profileDesc>\\n\\t</teiHeader>\\n\\t<text xml:lang=\"en\">\\n\\t\\t<body>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p><s>are well established. 2</s><s>Bei Betty was largely unknown until the opening of koeppen\\'s archive after his death in 1996, and the few scholars who do mention Bei Betty usually describe the script as a precursor to the postwar novel Tauben im Gras, likewise set in occupied Germany.</s><s>Jörg Döring reads Bei Betty as primarily \"biographically instructive,\" as koeppen\\'s first independent film text, and as a \"quarry\" for scenes, characters, and motifs that reappear in Tauben im Gras <ref type=\"bibr\">(\"Stehausschank\" 232,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">244)</ref>.</s><s>likewise, iris Denneler briefly mentions Bei Betty in discussing how \"film and prose were mutually influential\" in koeppen\\'s work <ref type=\"bibr\">(99)</ref>.</s><s>although screenplays are often treated as marginal cultural objects, there is good reason to treat them as developed visual narratives, and for placing Bei Betty within the larger context of koeppen\\'s postwar literary production and for reading it on its own terms.</s><s>Michael Mota conceptualizes screenplays as \"fluid, hybrid text[s] that stand ambivalently but suggestively poised between print and film technologies\" (\"Derek\" 217).</s><s>accordingly, screenplays \"produce and demand unique ways of seeing and reading,\" as they \"position the reader figuratively behind the camera, situating us as simultaneously reading and viewing subjects\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(\"Greenaway\\'s\" 230;</ref>.</s><s>i read the Bei Betty manuscript as both a visual literary text and as a developed narrative deserving of close attention in terms of content and structure.</s><s>3 While koeppen\\'s novels are famous for their extensive use of inner monologue, or the representation of interiority, the screenplay presents a surface visuality that suggests the impenetrability of the \"facades\" or the performative \"fronts\" that played a crucial role in postwar life.</s></p><p><s>in the following, i first situate the Bei Betty screenplay within koeppen\\'s other postwar work, as an unfinished contribution to the growing body of rubble films in production around 1947-48.</s><s>Second, i provide an overview of the screenplay, summarizing the story while highlighting koeppen\\'s many settings that show the sense of reality and unreality of the era of reconstruction.</s><s>third, i argue that koeppen\\'s focus on urban facades and newly-constructed lives also exposes the tension between performance and identity and the problem inherent in denazification processes: we only have acts and appearances, and cannot ever know someone\\'s true motivation or sincerity.</s><s>last, through a close reading of the story and its characters, i analyze how koeppen\\'s complex protagonists raise questions about war wounds that are both visible and invisible, on the bodies of those who lived through the war, as well as in the cityscape itself.</s></p><p><s>From the Dream Factory to Rubble Film like erich kästner, ernst von Salomon, and other non-Jewish writers who began their careers in the Weimar republic, and who were not forced into exile, the film industry provided koeppen with a means to make a living during the third reich.</s><s>koeppen\\'s biographer Jörg Döring provides a detailed account of <ref type=\"bibr\">koeppen\\'s work between 1933 and 1945</ref>, which included co-authorship of several screenplays and at least one finished film <ref type=\"bibr\">(\"…ich stellte mich\" 2001)</ref>. in later in-terviews, koeppen usually circumvented the topic, conceding that this employment offered him the ability to \"hide\" safely and comfortably in Nazi Germany and to escape military service, yet rarely discussing his desire to make films after the war. 4 in one interview, however, koeppen explicitly mentioned Bei Betty: \"1946 schrieb ich ein Drehbuch, \\'Bei Betty\\', das ein mit mir befreundeter Schauspieler und regisseur an einen einflußreichen hamburger Produzenten weitergab.</s><s>Das resultat war der kommentar: Warum will ihr Freund koeppen mich ruinieren?\"</s><s>(qtd. in treichel 206-07) at the time, \"rubble film\" was a pejorative, as audiences sought distraction and escape from the hardships of postwar life. in the 1951 novel Tauben im Gras, koeppen gives voice to such critique through the writer Philipp, who laments: \"Die leute hatten die Nase voll; sie hatten genug von der zeit, genug von den trümmern; die leute wollten nicht ihre Sorgen, nicht ihre Furcht, nicht ihren alltag, sie wollten nicht ihr elend gespiegelt sehen\" (14).</s><s>Philipp expresses koeppen\\'s own frustration with postwar moviegoers who believed film should not reflect but deflect from the ruins.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, koeppen\\'s interest in film before, during, and after the Second World War is apparent in the many references to the cinema-and the adaptation of cinematic techniques-in his novels.</s><s>Walter erhart notes koeppen\\'s \"tendency towards the visual,\" the mutual influence of koeppen\\'s filmic and literary production, and his play with mediality: \"to mutually probe and combine the two media, even to let them compete with one another\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(317,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">314)</ref>.</s><s>in Tauben im Gras, the many text fragments that make up the story contain cinematic transitions: \"hard and soft cuts,\" \"panning shots,\" and \"visible splices that create the transition to another sequence\" (Brink-Friederici 54).</s><s>through such techniques, koeppen\\'s narration directs the reader\\'s gaze, creating shifts in perspective that feel as if written for the screen.</s><s>yet his novels also do something that cinema cannot: especially the dense passages of inner monologue capitalize on the novel\\'s ability to represent the inner lives of characters, to freeze or slow time and to represent the depth of associative thought. in contrast, the Bei Betty screenplay represents koeppen\\'s attempt to create a work of art in the cinematic rather than a literary medium, focusing on surfaces rather than on interiority, and even revealing the potentially deceptive nature of these surfaces.</s></p><p><s>in published work from these years, there is evidence that koeppen was thinking about the possibilities for filmmaking in the ruins.</s><s>koeppen wrote multiple articles for the neue Zeitung that indicate his position within a broad network of actors, producers, and filmmakers, especially in 1947 as new rubble films were being made.</s><s>on 25 april 1947, koeppen published a short piece entitled \"Drehbeginn in Geiselgasteig,\" from the set of Zwischen gestern und morgen <ref type=\"bibr\">(harald Braun, 1947)</ref>, and a month later he mentions the set again in an article on the \"Welt im Film\" newsreels. 5</s><s>he vividly describes the experience of entering the set and being transported into a dream world, as the filmmakers had reconstructed Munich\\'s opulent regina Palast hotel. he comments ironically: \"hier haben wir das klassische Beispiel des Wiederaufbaues, von dem so viel gesprochen wird.</s><s>es ist alles wieder aufgebaut worden, und zwar in ein paar tagen\" (\"Drehbeginn\").</s><s>the hotel set presents itself as \"traum und Wirklichkeit des deutschen Wiederaufbaus,\" a fiction constructed to nonetheless appear real, preempting the hotel\\'s actual restoration.</s><s>koeppen published pieces on helmut käutner\\'s In jenen <ref type=\"bibr\">Tagen (1947)</ref>, the first film produced in the British zone, and, a few months later, on the need for directors who might develop a \"new film style\" in response to the lack of resources.</s><s>in a short text found among his papers, koeppen writes with regret about his failed film project: \"ich hätte auch die kamera in die hand genommen aber sie saßen wieder die gleiche runde\" (\"im Stehausschank\").</s><s>referring to the Bei Betty screenplay, koeppen expresses disappointment that the postwar film industry was controlled by the \"ghost of Goebbels,\" and that he was unable to produce a film that captured \"die kunst der erzählung in bildern.\"</s><s>koeppen hoped he would be among the innovative postwar German filmmakers, developing a cinematic mode of storytelling that also engaged with the politics of denazification, and German reconstruction as both \"traum und Wirklichkeit.\"</s><s>the Bei Betty screenplay read as an artifact of this period of both possibility and disappointment extends the cinematic metaphors of the illusory world of postwar reconstruction, by telling a story of the individuals struggling to make a new life in the stunde null.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>The Bei Betty Screenplay and its Cinematic Kulissen</head><p><s>Bei Betty is a crime story set in the postwar black market milieu of an unnamed city.</s><s>the plot revolves around an unsolved murder and the web of individuals connected to the victim, whose wartime pasts come into play in the course of the investigations.</s><s>the screenplay begins by showing the city in ruins, slowly coming to life again.</s><s>a voice-over introduces Betty, the energetic owner of a stehausschank, and her husband and stepdaughter, Günter and elisabeth halben.</s><s>the opening sequence ends with the ominous words: \"die Familie wäre zu neuem Wohlstand gelangt, wenn halben nicht an einem Nachmittag in ein kino gegangen wäre, wo er ermordet wurde.\" 6</s><s>the scene then cuts to the movie theater crime scene, where a doctor and detective have just found papers to identify the murder victim: Dr. Günter halben, Museum Director.</s><s>the police have no leads in the case until stolen art-a wooden Madonna statue-surfaces in the United States, authenticated by Dr. halben. in their investigation, the detectives learn that the deceased and his teenage daughter elisabeth were involved in the black market through Betty, whom halben had recently married.</s><s>a long flashback to 1945, focalized through elisabeth, reveals their backstory: halben and his daughter were refugees from the east, where halben, an art historian and Nazi Party member, directed a state museum.</s><s>Disillusioned by the catastrophic defeat, halben wants to put the past behind him, yet he is unable to find legitimate work because of his Nazi past, and ends up clearing rubble, struggling to house and feed his daughter.</s><s>elisabeth, in contrast, seems reluctant to accept new postwar realities and resents her father\\'s desire to move on.</s></p><p><s>Secondary characters complicate the plotline, turning it into a veritable web of wartime and postwar identities that link halben\\'s past and the postwar present, including Schallmaier, a former propaganda chief who knew halben, and Neck, a journalist who was denounced and spent time in a concentration camp.</s><s>We learn about halben\\'s difficulties finding work after the war and how he ends up meeting, working with, and eventually marrying Betty, much to the disappointment of his daughter.</s><s>elisabeth is isolated and becomes witness to her father\\'s participation in acts of deceit in black market trading and even murder.</s><s>the story ends with a surprising twist as we discover that elisabeth is the murderer responsible for her father\\'s death.</s><s>koeppen\\'s screenplay does not provide any direct explanation for the murder, but rather leaves us to question her motive and her presumed innocence.</s></p><p><s>like other rubble films written in the period from 1946 to 1949, Bei Betty depicts postwar challenges such as rehabilitation, reintegration, and physical and societal reconstruction. 7</s><s>robert Shandley defines rubble films by their common \"mise-en-scène of destroyed Germany,\" a background which also serves as a \"metaphor of the destruction of Germans\\' own sense of themselves\" (2).</s><s>With its period settings, complex characters, and flashback to 1945, Bei Betty links the physical rebuilding to the acts of self-reconstruction. the destroyed city is not just a background, but the screenplay engages with the identity crisis experienced by many contemporaries.</s><s>amanda randall proposes an \"expanded concept of Trümmerfilm,\" suggesting that \"Trümmerfilme might refer to a broader film semiotics of postwar, postfascist cultural crisis, where a film corpus finds its narrative structure through addressing a moment of traumatic cultural shift, its victims and what must be required of them as a way forward in a new geopolitical context\" (586).</s><s>as an artifact of the rubble period, Bei Betty addresses this cultural shift and provides a metadiscourse on the failures of denazification.</s></p><p><s>Starting with the crime scene in a movie theater, Bei Betty is staged in a series of settings typical for the postwar urban milieu, most of which are revealed to be set-like or provisional structures: the bar (stehausschank), Betty\\'s apartment (the site of black market dealings), a ruined museum, and the bunker where halben and elisabeth are first lodged upon their arrival in the city.</s><s>as Jennifer evans points out, spaces such as the bunker, the street, and bars were active agents in postwar life: \"Far from passive or neutral backdrops to social and cultural transformation, city spaces, even broken ones, play a constitutive part in shaping social identity and the operation of power\" (19). in Bei Betty, such spaces bring together a mélange of characters with very different pasts, and the broken and impromptu settings reflect the quickly-changing postwar world as spaces are repurposed or rebuilt.</s><s>the office distributing ration cards was once a school classroom, and the bunker where the two refugees are initially given shelter is scheduled for destruction.</s><s>thus, even the most monumental structure, the bunker, is revealed to be a Kulisse, a set or backdrop, taken down for a change in location, suggesting an analogy to the Wiederaufbau as both cinematic illusion and real space with polit-ical and social effects.</s><s>these various changes in setting further disrupt the characters, who seek security and a new order to their lives.</s></p><p><s>the Kulisse as theme appears throughout koeppen\\'s writings from the postwar period.</s><s>in the short story \"Vor dem Film\" (ca.</s><s>1948), the protagonist goes out to buy movie tickets at the request of his girlfriend, and in the process he becomes a flâneur in the ruins: \"Die läden waren nach der art von kulissen vor die ruinen der häuser gestellt, die früher da gestanden hatten, und die Straße ähnelte einer ladenstraße in einem Filmatelier.</s><s>Vor der kulisse, die einem Buchhändler gehörte, verweilte ich\" (Auf dem Phantasieross 367). the story presents the postwar rubble landscape as a film backdrop and reveals the tension between the surface, or what is seen, and a deeper, more complex reality shaped by personal memory and experience.</s><s>koeppen\\'s postwar novels play with similar motifs, often linking the rubble and reconstruction with the ways individuals reshape their lives in the war\\'s aftermath.</s><s>the protagonist of Das Treibhaus, Bundestag representative Felix keetenheuve, observes the acts of building all around him and realizes he is living through a \"neue Gründerzeit\": \"es war eine untergründige, eine hintergründige, eine begründet grundlose zeit auf flüchtigem sande habt ihr gebaut\" (119).</s><s>keetenheuve sees cinematic performances all around him: politicians as \"Statisten der politischen Bühne\" (53), parliament as a film premiere, the Chancellor as director, and the actual filming of political debates to the point at which reality and performance become blurred completely. he mocks one man as \"der große Memoirist,\" who thinks about \"ein neues kapitel seiner lukrativen Memoiren\" (116). in the postwar world, Germans are carefully constructing their appearance (and their biographies) in response to policies of denazification.</s><s>the novel\\'s incisive critique continually unmasks former Nazis and \"Mitläufer,\" at the same time that it also features the broken individuals who seem unable to \"play along.\"</s></p><p><s>although Bei Betty does not directly thematize postwar politics, the screenplay\\'s rubble settings contribute to the story\\'s mystery and further develop the motif of cinematic performance as it relates to reconstruction.</s><s>the title \"Bei Betty\" refers to both Betty\\'s apartment and her bar-both quintessential postwar spaces she controls with authority and that interiorize street life. in one scene, Betty pulls back a curtain and takes the detective to a small room behind the bar decorated with photographs of film stars, not only \"lifting the curtain,\" but revealing a mise-en-scène that references the illusory world of cinema.</s><s>koeppen\\'s rich description of the space includes auditory details (\"Man hört hier das radio und die Stimmen der Schankgäste\") and visual details of the \"windowless\" room and its furnishings.</s><s>like the bar, Betty\\'s apartment serves as a \"backstage\" space, crowded with people coming and going, jazz music playing, and a place full of scattered objects and period characters including american soldiers and German \"Fräuleins.\" in the apartment, the daughter elisabeth is always shown on a hängeboden, a lofted space overlooking the bathroom.</s><s>She literally has no ground under her feet, living and sleeping on a structure that provides a gallery view to the drama unfolding below, making her a witness to violence and conspiracy.</s><s>the screenplay\\'s settings such as the crowded apartment and bar reflect the impact of the air war on German cities: private and public had been turned inside out.</s><s>as Dagmar Barnouw notes, \"what had been visible had now become invisible, and what had been invisible was now visible; what had been public was now private; what had been private was now public\" (46).</s><s>koeppen\\'s staging highlights such postwar inversions and exposures, captured in photographs of the period that depict apartment blocks that look like dollhouses, or film sets, allowing viewers to see inside (see figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_0\">1</ref>). the set of Zwischen gestern und morgen, for example, which koeppen visited in 1947, used the half-destroyed regina Palast hotel with its grand staircase a ready-made set, split open on one side (see figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_1\">2</ref>). in Bei Betty, elisabeth is positioned in a similar space, able to watch the drama unfolding in the apartment below at the same time that we are invited to watch her, albeit at times she is concealed behind tinted glass (Milchglasscheibe).</s><s>Whereas koeppen\\'s novels continually expose the interiority of the characters, with extended passages of interior monologue, the film focuses on surfaces, eschewing our ability to read the thoughts or motivations of the characters.</s><s>sEDERBERG: Wolfgang Koeppen referring deictically to activities \"auch in unserer Stadt,\" koeppen sets the film in an unnamed ruined city.</s><s>the voiceover draws attention to the way that the rubble was cleared, making way for new constructions-sites of distraction and escape.</s><s>inhabitants of occupied Germany often complained that restaurants, cinemas, and shops were able to find the building materials needed (often on the black market) while housing projects suffered <ref type=\"bibr\">(Diefendorf 34</ref>).</s><s>koeppen\\'s 1956 preface to Tauben im Gras recycles this description of the postwar milieu, albeit here granting cinema a prominent place in describing the novel\\'s setting: \"als das deutsche Wirtschaftswunder im Westen aufging, als die ersten neuen kinos, die ersten neuen Versicherungspaläste die trümmer und die Behelfsläden überragten\" (9). in both texts koeppen thematizes an ambivalence about this mania to rebuild, suggesting that such constructions merely conceal the underlying brokenness-anticipating alexander and Margarethe Mitscherlich\\'s famous admonition about the Wirtschaftswunder and the Germans\\' energetic \"restoration of what had been destroyed\" (9).</s><s>this restoration, they argue, entailed an erasure of the past: \"hard work and success soon covered up the open wounds left by the past.</s><s>Where reconstruction and expansion took place, it was carried out almost literally on the same foundations as before-but never in any considered connection with tradition\" (13).</s><s>Decades later, Sebald revived this discussion by writing of the \"stream of psychic energy\" invested in reconstruction, and the \"well-kept secret of the corpses built into the foundations of our state\" (13).</s><s>koeppen\\'s work preempts such critique, through deictic gestures pointing to the work of reconstruction, both in the city and in the lives of its inhabitants.</s></p><p><s>\"Eine neue Existenz\": Self-Fashioning in Postwar Germany in the ruins of German cities, a world of unstable and shifting settings, many individuals revised their biography, seeking to make a life for themselves in the stunde null under new political circumstances of allied occupation. 8</s><s>in interviews in the 1950s and 1960s, koeppen repeatedly described the unbelievable turn of events at the war\\'s end, when former Nazis quickly changed their political views: \"ich war erstaunt, daß ich unter lauter anti-Nazis gelebt hatte\" (qtd. in treichel 102).</s><s>koeppen was also critical of the allied program of \"denazification,\" which he found \"falsch und lächerlich,\" as he saw many former Nazis resume positions of power under allied occupation (qtd. in treichel 106).</s><s>Bei Betty problematizes the injustices of denazification, as the story\\'s characters demonstrate a range of responses to the \"zero hour\" as an opportunity to remake themselves. 9</s><s>By contrasting the former Party members Schallmaier and halben, koeppen juxtaposes earnest and feigned acts of denazification.</s><s>in the postwar years, the term \"Säuberung\" was more commonly used for the allied process of Entnazifizierung, as Germans sought a so-called \"Persilschein,\" or documentation that would mark them as \"clean.\" 10</s><s>in the Bei Betty script, water is frequently mentioned as a visual and auditory motif; the screenplay describes \"rauschen von Wasser in röhren, tropfendes Wasser,\" washing, and rain.</s><s>Water, symbolizing rebirth, or purification is repeatedly invoked in connection with elisabeth and halben-characters who must but cannot shed their past.</s><s>however, in koeppen\\'s screenplay, denazification is not accomplished through \"Säuberung,\" but through performance, or what sociologist erving Goffman famously described as the \"front\" presented in everyday life <ref type=\"bibr\">(22)</ref>.</s><s>the film\\'s plot revolves around the tension between the need to reorient oneself in order to make a living in the postwar order, or at least to successfully perform a \"denazified\" self, and the confusion and anger about such biographical ruptures.</s><s>these performances and the \"unmasking\" of several characters beg the question: What would successful denazification \"look\" like?</s><s>Betty\\'s stehausschank, as a symbolic provisional structure of the postwar years, embodies postwar acts of reconstruction.</s><s>the bar brings together a microcosm of postwar society, and it is here that halben encounters two men he knew from the Nazi era: former propaganda chief Schallmaier, and the journalist Neck.</s><s>Schallmaier (whose name invokes illusory schall und Rauch) represents the Nazis who were able to toss their wartime identity aside and put on a new mask, as stated in the exposé: \"er hat schon eine erstaunliche routine und eine noch erstaunlichere Vorurteilslosigkeit entwickelt\" (\"eine von den Werwölfen\" 4).</s><s>Schallmaier recalls the character of Ferdinand Brückner from the first postwar German film Die Mörder sind unter uns <ref type=\"bibr\">(Wolfgang Staudte, 1946)</ref>, a formerly ruthless Wehrmacht officer who capitalizes on the transition from war to postwar life, turning helmets into cooking pots.</s><s>Brückner serves as a foil to hans Mertens, who is plagued by traumatic wartime experiences and guilt. in Bei Betty, there is a similar juxtaposition of characters who respond differently to the past.</s><s>as his name suggests, halben is caught \"halfway\" between worlds, in limbo as his status as a former Parteigenosse (Pg., party member) prevents him from seeking honest employment.</s></p><p><s>halben\\'s future is also uncertain because he is an art historian, a profession that ties him to the past and to a cultural tradition now uncertain.</s><s>Seeking to resume his art historical work, halben visits Bögemann, the director of the local city museum.</s><s>through this encounter, which takes place in the ruins of the partially destroyed museum, koeppen stages a dialogue about rehabilitation and reconstruction in yet another symbolically charged setting:</s></p><p><s>Bögemann ist über halbens Besuch, der ihn fragt, ob er am Wiederaufbau des Museums mitarbeiten könne, nicht erfreut.</s><s>er sagt unwillig und bitter, er könne ihm fegen helfen.</s><s>Und er deutet an, dass ja halben mit schuld daran sei, wenn man hier zunächst einmal fegen müsse, statt sich mit kunst zu beschäftigen.</s><s>halben gibt zu, sich getäuscht zu haben.</s><s>er habe an den Führer geglaubt.</s><s>(Und dafür ein hochsubventioniertes Museum bekommen, sagt Bögemann).</s><s>aber er habe den krieg und alles, was mit dem krieg gekommen sei, nicht gewollt.</s><s>er sei jetzt ehrlich bereit, an einer neuen zukunft mitzuarbeiten.</s><s>\"Wenn man Sie lassen wird\" sagt Bögemann.</s><s>\"Bei uns sind alle Pg.s [sic] rausgeflogen\".</s><s>(Bild 27) 11   Bögemann voices the position that former Nazis should be doing the rubbleclearing, even mentioning the fact that individuals and institutions profited during the war.</s><s>the melancholic undertones and his stated remorse create sympathy for halben, at the same time that Bögemann\\'s character voices the unpopular truth that the National Socialists bear responsibility for the destruction.</s><s>halben also visits an allied Collecting Point, where he meets an officer who would like him to help find and catalog lost artworks-but here, also, his Party membership is an insurmountable obstacle and the allies cannot hire him.</s><s>hungry, desperate, and unable to find work, halben ends up clearing rubble to get a better ration card. it is here, working as a \"rubble man,\" that halben meets Betty, who notices how he struggles with the physical labor.</s><s>\"Was sind Sie eigentlich von Beruf ?\" she asks. he answers, \"kunsthistoriker.</s><s>Damit ist nicht viel anzufangen.\"</s><s>halben is stuck, unable to start a new life in a future-oriented postwar order.</s></p><p><s>By showing rubble in this way-not romanticized, but as an ambivalent sign of both the burden of the past, the hardship of the present, and the possibility for remaking the future-Bei Betty reminds us that the mythologization of the \"Stunde Null\" came later.</s><s>the way that rubble (and the clearing of rubble) became resignified as part of the narrative of West German recovery and progress was one possible narrative among others.</s><s>as elizabeth heineman has argued, the collective memory of a stereotypically female experience of the war\\'s end was universalized in the development of a West German identity that emphasized German suffering and victimhood (355).</s><s>Many other rubble films and their redemptive narratives contributed to the mythologization of the Trümmerfrau, the Wiederaufbau, and the Wirtschaftswunder.</s><s>a prime example is the film und über uns der himmel <ref type=\"bibr\">( Josef von Báky, 1947)</ref>, which shows rubble-clearing as an altruistic and self-sacrificing act, a symbol for Germans\\' eagerness to rebuild and survive the hardship of the postwar period.</s><s>in one scene, a view of the half-ruined kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche cuts to a panning shot of ruins, images of smiling Trümmerfrauen, and men jackhammering and building.</s><s>hans albers, a star in the third reich, plays the protagonist hans richter, who walks by these industrious Germans to an optimistic tune about reconstruction.</s><s>the film rehabilitates hans albers/hans richter at the same time that the filmic language provides a positive message about the future of Germany, eliciting pity for German suffering.</s><s>Die Mörder sind unter uns, which begins with the psychologically broken hans Mertens, also contains a redemptive narrative and an industrious Trümmerfrau, who clears the domestic space of its rubble and helps to \"cure\" Mertens.</s></p><p><s>rubble clearing was not primarily the work of well-intentioned, selfless women, as leonie treber demonstrates in Mythos Trümmerfrauen. in fact, rubble clearing was often punitive labor (strafarbeit); it was often done by men; it was used to shame former Party members, and it was quickly professionalized and mechanized <ref type=\"bibr\">(198)</ref>. in contrast to the rubble film narratives that invoke sympathy for Germany, the scene with Bögemann and halben in the ruined museum directly links the rubble to National Socialism and also to the retaliatory or penal nature of rubble work.</s><s>halben is presented as genuinely well-intentioned (\"er sei jetzt ehrlich bereit, an einer neuen zukunft mitzuarbeiten\") and makes great efforts to seek legal employment.</s><s>Schallmeier, in contrast, reveals some of the challenges of the allied denazification policies concerning individuals eager to \"play the part.\"</s><s>halben\\'s conversation with Bögemann about reconstruction stages a complicated moral dilemma about what to do with individuals who may want to help rebuild but who are unable to do so.</s></p><p><s>the stolen Madonna statue is another detail in the film that further complicates the characters\\' identities and their relation to the past, and several plot twists center on the statue, which alternately represents guilt and absolution.</s><s>halben and elisabeth rescued the wooden Madonna statue from the burning museum at the war\\'s end and brought it with them as they fled westward.</s><s>as a stolen and yet valuable object, the Madonna statue poses both an opportunity and a threat sEDERBERG: Wolfgang Koeppen in this exchange, it is clear that the Madonna is stolen property, but the statue also seems stateless in the aftermath of the war-like the homeless refugees elisabeth and Günter halben themselves.</s><s>on another level, this dialogue raises questions about cultural property and cultural heritage, as well as the place of art and religion in the world of ruins.</s><s>as halben notes, leaving the Madonna in the bunker is \"unmöglich.\"</s><s>Ultimately, halben makes a pact with Betty, and decides to sell the statue after the currency reform in order to start a business-the titular stehausschank.</s><s>this object represents what the Mitscherlichs would later identify in The Inability to Mourn as the \"[substantial] economic gain from this ability to forget, this alienation from one\\'s own past, this erection of a collective taboo\" (20).</s><s>to cover up the \"open wounds left by the past,\" Germans transferred their energies into postwar reconstruction and the \"economic miracle\" (13). in koeppen\\'s story, the illegal sale of the statue is what enables halben\\'s new life, and the purchase of the bar represents a move from the past into the future.</s><s>the statue not only allows halben and Betty to buy the bar, but it later becomes the key piece of evidence in the murder case. the police detectives have no leads until a lucky turn of events: american officers have begun to ask around for a Dr. halben, who had \"offered his expertise\" in the sale of stolen art. a 40-centimenter Madonna statue by Veit Stoss surfaced in the United States and was confiscated. 12</s><s>koeppen\\'s choice of this artist, a late Gothic sculptor popular during the Nazi era, adds another fraught reference to the National Socialists\\' obsession with a racialized Germanic heritage and the politics of art restitution after the war.</s><s>the Veit Stoss Madonna statue is yet another trace of the Nazi past that haunts halben and his daughter, reemerging unexpectedly.</s><s>as a displaced and stolen work, the statue hints at the guilt and shame that they carry with them, another piece of the past that they cannot easily discard.</s></p><p><s>A Rubble Man and a Nazi Girl: Characterology of Post-Fascism the mysterious murder that shapes the screenplay\\'s storyline is an act of patricide that not only upsets traditional gendering of the father-son conflict, but also challenges the conventional figure of the overly zealous hitler youth.</s><s>according to the 5-page exposé, the film\\'s working subtitle was \"eine von den Werwölfen,\" in reference to the ultra-committed Nazi resistance fighters trained in guerilla tactics-an ineffective last-ditch effort to sabotage allied progress at the war\\'s end.</s><s>immediately, however, the feminine article \"eine\" challenges our expectations of young, ideologically committed \"Werwolf \" fighters.</s><s>rubble films were full of rebellious young boys, such as 12-year-old edmund in roberto rossellini\\'s Germania Anno <ref type=\"bibr\">Zero (1947)</ref>, who ends up murdering his father, in part due to the influence of a former Nazi teacher; Gustav from Irgendwo in Berlin <ref type=\"bibr\">(Gerhard lamprecht, 1946)</ref>, part of a band of unruly children with absent fathers who have only known war, \"shooting and breaking things,\" or hellmuth Behnke from Wolfgang Staudte\\'s Rotation (1949) who denounces his father.</s><s>in the postwar period, concern about \"politically radicalized\" or \"lost\" youth became a \"symbol of greater societal breakdown,\" as Benjamin Möckel writes, standing in for a range of anxieties about national and social rehabilitation after National Socialism (191).</s><s>koeppen\\'s creation of a young female character who embodies these same anxieties is an important variation on the typical theme, reflecting a wider societal malaise about postwar youth.</s></p><p><s>although the title suggests that Betty is the central character, it is the fatherdaughter relationship that structures the story.</s><s>the enigmatic young elisabeth is portrayed as a smart but confused girl-the age 15 (in 1948, age 12 during the flashback) locates her between child and woman, in a liminal space of both innocence and maturity.</s><s>her age also makes her a direct product of the third reich, born in 1933.</s><s>elisabeth\\'s ambiguous status as girl/woman contributes to the suspense, as the police (and presumably the audience as well) are unable to see her as a murderer.</s><s>the police detectives speak in a \"fatherly\" tone to her, they refer to her as \"kleines Fräulein,\" and behind closed doors they murmur, \"Schade um das kind.\" as Jaimey Fisher argues in Disciplining Germany, the \"unavoidable ambivalence toward youth guilt is exactly the remarkable point.</s><s>it was precisely this complexity, this ambivalence, this muddledness that postwar authors, intellectuals, and filmmakers would instrumentalize in approaching questions of German guilt and the past in general\" (14-15).</s><s>koeppen leverages this \"muddledness\" to present a complicated dilemma about young and adult Germans with a Nazi past. in her first appearance, elisabeth clutches a newspaper article about hitler\\'s visit to her father\\'s museum, establishing her reluctance to let go of the past.</s><s>the character of a young girl who remains ideologically committed to National Socialism, even going so far as to murder her own father, sends a clear message about the need for reeducation at the same time that the violent storyline reflects pessimism about the future.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, elisabeth is also repeatedly aligned with the Madonna figure.</s><s>erica Carter describes how the Madonna figure appears prominently in postwar visual culture and early postwar films-usually signifying universal suffering and loss (104-05).</s><s>Madonna imagery contributed to a \"foundational mythology\" of selective remembering and forgetting that privileged German victimhood <ref type=\"bibr\">(Denman 199)</ref>. in Bei Betty, however, koeppen contests this imagery head-on by associating the former BDM girl with the Madonna. in one scene in Betty\\'s apartment, one of the German women sarcastically calls elisabeth \"unsere heilige.\"</s><s>later, when elisabeth is interviewed by the police, their question about the Madonna (\"Was weißt du von der Madonna?\") triggers her flashback to 1945, providing their backstory.</s><s>Much of the film is thus framed through the figure of elisabeth, who remains a mystery, signifying both innocence and lost youth, as well as complicity in the Nazi past.</s><s>this character also represents \"pure\" performance-we as viewers cannot gain access to her thoughts and motivations.</s></p><p><s>although elisabeth and Betty are linked through their names, elisabeth is also bound in several ways to the character of Neck, a victim of the Nazis who was interned in a concentration camp, possibly due to a denunciation by halben.</s><s>he is physically and psychologically damaged from the war, with a paralyzed arm and clear symptoms of wartime trauma.</s><s>Neck has become an alcoholic, frequenting Betty\\'s bar in search of escape.</s><s>elisabeth and Neck both seem figuratively paralyzed, unable to come to terms with postwar life. in one scene after halben\\'s death, they are both alone at the bar in the morning.</s><s>elisabeth is shown washing glasses when Neck arrives, looking for a drink.</s></p><p><s>elisabeth: Warum trinken Sie soviel?</s><s>Warum kommen Sie hierher?</s><s>Neck: irgendwo muss man ja hingehen elisabeth: aber Sie sind doch nicht schlecht, herr Neck Neck: Du bist doch auch nicht schlecht und bist hier elisabeth: Doch, ich bin schlecht <ref type=\"bibr\">(Bild 18)</ref> these characters cannot escape the past and seem to have no future.</s><s>Neck is in search of refuge, \"irgendwo muss man ja hingehen,\" recalling elisabeth\\'s earlier conversation with her father about the German state, \"den gibt es ja gar nicht mehr.\"</s><s>Both characters have a hidden wound; they are lost in the postwar world and do not or cannot contribute to reconstruction.</s></p><p><s>the curious use of the term \"schlecht,\" which signifies guilt or moral judgment, resurfaces more explicitly at the film\\'s end, in a dramatic final sequence that juxtaposes elisabeth\\'s and Neck\\'s guilt and innocence.</s><s>Neck and elisabeth, headed to the police and the church respectively, are each about to give a confessionone criminal and one religious; one dishonest and one honest.</s><s>Seemingly inexplicably, Neck goes to the police and confesses to the murder of Günter halben.</s><s>yet Neck, whose right arm is paralyzed, could not have produced the righthanded stab wound, and he is ultimately released.</s><s>then, the plot twists and elisabeth goes from the church to the police, and Neck goes from the police to the bar. in a series of six quickly interchanging shots, koeppen juxtaposes the two characters.</s><s>First, elisabeth is shown on the main square between the church and police headquarters.</s><s>Next, Neck leaves the detectives and walks down a \"long, sad hallway.\"</s><s>elisabeth then enters the same building and walks towards the camera down a similarly \"long, sad hallway.\"</s><s>after we see Neck go down a set of stairs, we see elisabeth going up.</s><s>Neck is then shown heading towards the church, after which elisabeth enters the interrogation room and puts a knife on the table .</s><s>the final scene of the screenplay describes Neck walking past the church, across the square, to Betty\\'s bar, nestled in the ruins.</s><s>What is described as a high angle creates a triangular movement between the church, police headquarters, and the bar. the cross-cutting between the church and the police, institutions representing religion and the state, suggests a nexus of religious guilt and political guilt, and the possibilities for absolution or forgiveness-as opposed to the state\\'s search for justice.</s><s>the stehausschank, as an impermanent fixture in the postwar landscape, represents both a place of forgetting and moving on.</s></p><p><s>after elisabeth gives the murder weapon to the police, turning herself in as her father\\'s murderer, the audience is left over her motivations and the significance of this act.</s><s>in the film exposé, koeppen offers one interpretation: \"elisabeth hat ihren Vater aus abscheu, Verachtung, enttäuschung getötet.</s><s>es war vielleicht weniger das enttäuschtsein von Menschen, als das enttäuschtsein von einer Weltanschauung, einer erziehung, einem jugendlichen idol\" (5). the act of patricide is the symbolic divorce from the past, the National Socialist Weltanschauung, and the \"father figure\" of hitler.</s><s>however, in the screenplay there is no voice-over; none of these rationales is offered directly.</s><s>in contrast to koeppen\\'s novels, which explore the expansive and associative nature of human consciousness, the screenplay eschews this depth.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the last image is not of elisabeth, but of Neck, walking towards Betty\\'s bar.</s><s>By pairing Neck and elisabeth in this climactic sequence, koeppen ends with a disturbing image of a man who has been broken by the war and is now alone at home in the rubble.</s><s>interestingly, this parallels the opening scene of Staudte\\'s Die Mörder sind unter uns, in which hans Mertens staggers through the ruins to a bar. it is an undoing of the neat, redemptive narrative, exposing the complexity of guilt in postwar Germany and leaving open questions of motive.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>By the time koeppen published the novel Tauben im Gras in 1951, he had a much more cynical stance towards the postwar film industry-perhaps disillusioned with the failure of his own film project.</s><s>Using a collage style reminiscent of Döblin\\'s Berlin Alexanderplatz, koeppen inserts newspaper headlines into the narrative, many of which refer to film consumption: \"Schlagzeilen der Filmblätter: ale-xaNDer SPielt DeN erzherzoG, Der DeUtSChe SUPerFilM, Der erzherzoG UND Die FiSCheriN,\" \"BeSSere FilMe iM NeUeN DeUtSChlaND, lieGt eS aM DrehBUCh, DiChter aN Die FilMFroNt… NeorealiSMUS NiCht Mehr GeFraGt\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Tauben 13,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">183)</ref>.</s><s>koeppen weaves contemporary discourse about the cinematic medium and genre into the novel, reflecting on possibilities of representation in the postwar present. he uses the wartime rhetoric of \"Filmfront\" to demonstrate the continuities between wartime and postwar filmmaking, a theme he returns to in Das Treibhaus as well, as he juxtaposes Nazi slogans with images from the postwar newsreels (123).</s><s>his novels\\' characters go to the movies at the same time that they voice criticisms of cinema as escape, and the increasing sense of unreality as one moves out of the cinema into the \"real\" world.</s></p><p><s>in Bei Betty, as in his postwar novels, koeppen challenges viewers to see postwar Germany and the Wiederaufbau through the lens of the cinema, exposing the blurred lines between cinematic illusion and outward \"reality,\" and calling attention to the performances of everyday life.</s><s>the first character introduced in Tauben im Gras is the film star alexander, who is being dressed to play an archduke in a costume drama.</s><s>alexander himself finds no satisfaction in such roles, and feels unsure of his postwar identity: \"Man verwechselte alexander mit seinem Schatten.</s><s>es machte ihn schwindlig.</s><s>Wer war er? ein draufgängerisch-treu-sentimental-kühner-helden-Potenter? er hatte es satt.</s><s>er war müde.</s><s>er war ausgeheldet\" (Tauben 148).</s><s>this character, the actor, is unsure of the roles he is playing and his true identity.</s><s>in Das Treibhaus, representative keetenheuve can likewise no longer distinguish between performance and reality, especially as an observer of \"Statisten der politischen Bühne\" (53-116).</s><s>Watching a scene in the Bundestag play out as it is being filmed for the Wochenschau, he feels that the politicians look like actors playing politicians: \"das Jahrhundert artete seinen Filmschauspielern nach, und selbst ein Bergarbeiter sah schon wie ein kumpel aus, der dargestellt wird\" (Treibhaus 168). in Bei Betty, there are no actors, but subtle hints that call attention to the way both spaces and individuals are being rebuilt and remade for the postwar world.</s><s>the filmic narrative features characters who thematize issues of guilt and innocence, as well as the conflict between those unable to leave their (National Socialist) past behind and former Nazis who seek rehabilitation and a new future.</s></p><p><s>Unlike other early rubble films, that helped shape the West German origin story of the Wirtschaftswunder, koeppen shows the personal histories behind acts of reconstruction.</s><s>Betty\\'s bar, which gives the film its name, is built with money from a stolen work of art.</s><s>this new beginning for a small family builds on a traumatic foundation, with a story of displacement, loss of identity, and insecurity about the future.</s><s>the story leaves many questions unanswered, a dark counterpoint to postwar redemption narratives that highlights the biographical ruptures often hidden in the rubble.</s><s>With the ending left open, it is unclear whether Neck and elisabeth will be successful at refashioning themselves for a new, postwar order.</s><s>Unlike hans Mertens, hans richter, or other typical characters of rubble films, these characters are not \"saved\" in the end.</s><s>instead, koeppen seems to suggest the political and moral confession as a viable alternative for remaking oneself, and beginning a longer, more difficult process of self-healing.</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"

is coming to resemble the Old World, both in regard to the behavior of their fragmented political elites and the resentment-laden attitudes of their mass publics.</s><s>What was once labeled \"American exceptionalism\" by prominent analysts was largely a product of the peculiar conditions of the postwar era (1945-1965), conditions that no longer depict current realities.</s></p></div>\\n\\t\\t\\t</abstract>\\n\\t\\t</profileDesc>\\n\\t</teiHeader>\\n\\t<text xml:lang=\"en\">\\n\\t\\t<body>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><p><s>In the aftermath of the Cold War, the American-led war in Iraq, conflicting attitudes toward the state of Israel, competing views over the limits of the welfare state, and a substantial list of other considerations, many analysts have reached the conclusion that the United States and the countries of Western Europe are growing further and further apart. <ref type=\"bibr\">1</ref></s><s>No doubt this \"growing apart\" perspective has been reinforced lately by the disclosures about US electronic surveillance of the Continent\\'s prominent leaders.</s><s>It would be hard to imagine anything would be more likely to increase European suspicion than Washington\\'s evidently longstanding policy of monitoring the private communications of European leaders and publics.</s><s>In short, America is from Mars, Europe is from Venus.</s></p><p><s>Despite what appears to be a prima facie case, we maintain that the United States and the countries of Western Europe are, if anything, drifting toward one another, but at different paces.</s><s>In this article, we intend to explore this Address correspondence to Susanne Martin, Department of Political Science, University of Nevada-Reno, Mail Stop 0302, Reno, NV 89557.</s><s>E-mail: susannemartin@unr.edu</s><s>aggregation-one that enjoyed support among ethnic German immigrants from the East forced out by the victorious Soviets.</s><s>So organized political opposition to the new Bonn democracy was very limited.</s><s>Moreover, the German \"economic miracle\" of the 1950s radically reduced the prospects of labor union militancy.</s><s>The Christian Democrats, under the leadership of Konrad Adenauer and Ludwig Erhard, created a \"social-market\" economy, which combined private enterprise with a substantial welfare state. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b0\">2</ref> Influential analysts of these postwar decades observed a number of considerations that made the persistence of democracy difficult.</s><s>Either implicitly or explicitly, these analysts compared the newly restored West European democracies to their more successful American counterpart.</s><s>For example, Giovanni Sartori saw a major difference in the way continental Europeans and Americans learned and then applied what they had learned (e.g., Roman law vs. common law).</s><s>It was a matter of deductive versus inductive reasoning.</s><s>The European tradition (see Descartes) was one that stressed the learning of abstract principles and then applying them deductively to practical cases.</s><s>This propensity toward deduction made Europeans more susceptible to abstract ideologies in their assessments of politics.</s><s>Americans, Sartori claimed, were more likely to reason by induction, reaching the general from specific cases and examples.</s><s>America was the home of pragmatism (e.g., William James, John Dewey) after all.</s><s>As a result Americans were less likely to view politics through a set of ideological predispositions. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">3</ref></s><s>bservers reached similar conclusions about what was then the emerging field of inquiry into political culture.</s><s>French and Italian political cultures were characterized by popular alienation from the political order.</s><s>In general, Italians and French people tended to be deeply mistrustful of their governments and profoundly alienated from the institutions of the democratic order. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">4</ref></s><s>urthermore, these observers noted France and Italy were subdivided into mutually suspicious subcultures erected around social class, religion, and region.</s><s>(The same might be said about Austria and Belgium.)</s><s>By contrast, Germans or West Germans were not alienated so much as they were passive.</s><s>Scarred by the Nazi experience, Germans took little pride in the new Bonn democracy.</s><s>Furthermore, they tended to see themselves as \"subjects\"-the passive recipients of government policy-but not as \"citizens\" able to shape the policy decisions. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b4\">5</ref></s><s>arty politics in France, Italy, and the German Federal Republic during the 1950s were typically polarized.</s><s>It is true that Bonn banned the communist party, but the country\\'s Social Democrats under the leadership of Kurt Schumacher and Eric Ollenhauer persisted in their commitments to Marxism until the party\\'s 1959 Bad Godesberg conference accepted capitalism in its social market framework.</s><s>Both the French Fourth Republic and Italy\\'s post-Fascist democracy had party systems in which electorally powerful Communist parties expressed very limited commitments to the democratic rules of the game.</s><s>(Internally, the parties were organized on the basis of democratic centralism principles.)</s><s>And given the Cold War atmosphere of the era, the communists were excluded or excluded themselves from governing coalitions.</s><s>The far right in France, Italy, and West Germany was thoroughly discredited as the result of the World War II catastrophe.</s><s>The far-right parties that were too explicit in their expression of sympathy for the fascist past (see above) risked being placed outside the law.</s><s>Nonetheless, parties committed to Algerie Francais or to the use of violence to prevent a communist presence in government and a revival of nationalism began to put down roots that would later begin to grow during the 1960s.</s><s>With a few exceptions here and there-for example, C. Wright Mills or William Appleton Williams-scholars tended overwhelmingly to paint American political life in the most positive terms.</s><s>At the level of ideas, such intellectual historians as Louis Hartz stressed the abiding consensus around the principles of Lockean liberalism. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">6</ref></s><s>Whether they were conscious of it or not, Americans overwhelmingly supported the natural rights of life, liberty, and property as reflected in the country\\'s founding documents.</s><s>What passed for left and right in the United States were really two sides of the same coin.</s><s>For historical reasons, America lacked a hereditary aristocracy, a monarchy, a landless peasantry, and an established church-institutions that in Europe had given rise to both a militant socialist movement and a conservative one in reaction to it.</s></p><p><s>For other historians writing in the 1950s, the American environment itself promoted political consensus.</s><s>By contrast with Europe, America was a land of abundance where socialism \"foundered on shoals of roast beef and apple pie.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">7</ref></s><s>s a consequence, instead of class conflict and an alienated urban working class characteristic of European politics, America was a place of upward social mobility where individuals from blue-collar backgrounds could rise to the heights of economic and social success.</s><s>The mass media of the era offered examples to depict the possibilities.</s></p><p><s>Americans\\' attitudes toward their political system tended to reflect these positive views.</s><s>Instead of the alienation, mistrust, and passivity that typified political cultures in Western Europe, America had a robust civic culture.</s><s>Below we report some of the findings of Almond and Verba\\'s seminal volume The Civic Culture, a book originally published in 1963 but based on cross-national opinion surveys dating from the late 1950s. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">8</ref></s><s>irst, by comparison with individuals from the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Mexico, Americans were far more likely to express pride in their country\\'s governmental and political institutions.</s><s>Americans were close to being twice as \"proud\" of their institutions as respondents from the United Kingdom and nearly three times as \"proud\" as respondents from Mexico.</s><s>The gap between Americans\\' pride and that of Germans and Italians was far more dramatic.</s><s>Americans were also relatively trusting of their institutions and believed they had the ability to do something if they considered a law or government decision to be unjust.</s><s>In addition, Americans were more trusting of \"most\" of their neighbors than their counterparts were.</s><s>Again the gap was largest between Americans\\' attitudes and those of Germans and Italians.</s><s>In terms of political participation, American attitudes, taken together, exhibited a judicious mix of active participants and passive subjects. <ref type=\"bibr\">9</ref></s><s>Almond and Verba reasoned that a culture composed largely of active citizens would become overheated and too conflict-ridden to permit the political system to function effectively.</s><s>Taken together, these clusters of attitudes permitted the writers to characterize the United States as having a civic culture, one that fit with the attributes of a healthy, viable democracy.</s></p><p><s>These and other findings led Almond and Verba to describe the American political culture as follows:</s></p><p><s>The pattern of political culture found in the United States approximates what we have called the civic culture.</s><s>There are several significant components in this cultural pattern. .</s><s>.. respondents in the United States, compared with those in the other four nations, are very frequently exposed to politics.</s><s>They report political discussion and involvement in political affairs, a sense of obligation to take an active part in the community, and a sense of competence to influence the government.. . .</s><s>Furthermore, . . .</s><s>they have a high degree of pride in the political system.</s><s>And their attachment to the political system includes both generalized system affect as well as satisfaction with specific governmental performance. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">10</ref></s><s>erican party politics during this era were also depicted favorably in comparison with their continental counterparts.</s><s>These positive judgments were rendered at both the individual and systemic levels.</s><s>Whatever else their failings, the Republicans and Democrats were typically depicted as loosely organized and decentralized aggregations seeking the support of voters across the political spectrum. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">11</ref></s><s>Unlike Western Europe\\'s mass parties, the Republicans and Democrats sought the electoral support from all sectors of society.</s><s>As a result, they were driven toward the center where they competed for the support of moderate voters.</s><s>As a consequence and after elections, at least, both parties\\' leaders stressed the benefits of compromise.</s></p><p><s>While the United States had a two-party system in which the major contestants competed for the center, the French, German, and Italian systems were characterized by multi-partyism.</s><s>And certainly in the French and Italian cases, the parties did not compete for the same segment of the electoral center.</s><s>Parties of the left and right competed with those parties closest to them on the ideological spectrum. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">12</ref></s><s>Communists, for example, competed with socialists for the support for the same working-class segment of the electorate.</s><s>Party competition tended to reinforce political divisions rather than serve to moderate them.</s><s>This circumstance led the political scientist Arend Lijphart to distinguish political party systems on the basis of their centripetal versus centrifugal drives. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">13</ref></s><s>The American system was \"centripetal\" in the sense that its dynamic was toward the center, toward consensus and moderation, while the continental European system was \"centrifugal\" in that it tended to pull apart and give rise to extremism.</s><s>Some observers explained these differences based largely on the ways the vote was counted. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">14</ref></s><s>With the \"political formula\" employed in the United States, winning and losing was based on a simple plurality of votes cast.</s><s>The proportional representation (PR) system used in much of Western European parliamentary elections assigned seats to parties on the basis of the percentage of the vote they received in multi-member constituencies.</s><s>The American system, because it tended to manufacture simple majorities, supported twopartyism, while the European PR alternative promoted or did little to retard multi-partyism.</s></p><p><s>The trouble with this explanation is that it did not fit the French and German cases.</s><s>Italy continued to use PR throughout the 1950s, but neither France nor Germany did.</s><s>In the latter case, decision-makers took into consideration the Weimar experience, one where PR was used to elect members of the Reichstag-with calamitous results.</s><s>To avoid a repeat of the Weimar outcome, policy-makers in Bonn imposed a five percent minimum requirement before a party could achieve representation in the Bundestag.</s><s>They also assigned voters two ways of making their preferences known, one of which required voters in single-member districts to select deputies based on the plurality formula.</s><s>Half the members of the Bonn parliament were chosen on this basis, the other half through the use of a PR formula.</s></p><p><s>For most of the French Fourth Republic (1946-1958), parliamentary deputies were selected on the basis of a single-member district, the arrondissement, with a runoff in the case no candidate received a majority at the first balloting.</s><s>Despite this formula, parliaments during the Fourth Republic continued to exhibit extreme multi-partyism.</s></p><p><s>These observations suggest that the way the votes were counted in these three countries was not decisive in explaining their political party systems.</s><s>The Scandinavian countries used PR throughout the 1950s and had multiparty systems, but without the serious social and political problems France, Germany, and Italy confronted.</s></p><p><s>The largely American social scientists and historians who painted this picture of American democracy side-by-side with its West European counterparts managed to overlook serious strains in US life during the 1950s.</s><s>Not only did the country go through an episode of anti-communist hysteria linked to the term \"McCarthyism,\" but it also, and more importantly, suffered from racial segregation and the stirrings of the racial integration movement that would come alive in the succeeding decade.</s><s>Nor did these same social scientists and consensus historians anticipate the turmoil of the 1960s and the Watergate scandal in the 1970s.</s><s>Nor did they imagine the end of the Cold War.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>WHAT\\'S NEW?</head><p><s>First, we should point out that none of the three major continental West European democracies has suffered an interruption in its democratic system since the late 1950s.</s><s>And following Franco\\'s death, Spain went through a surprisingly smooth transition to democratic rule.</s><s>France, though, might be treated as an exception because of its brief interlude from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic in the period 1958-1959 when General de Gaulle, acting with parliamentary approval, ruled by decree for six months in an effort to resolve the Algerian crisis.</s><s>In fact, following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992, the countries of Eastern Europe tended to model their new states along West European democratic lines.</s><s>And under the auspices of the European Union, the West European democracies invested millions of euros in promoting democratic developments in the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and other parts of the world where the blessings of liberty were largely unknown.</s><s>Like its continental counterparts, the American democracy persisted uninterrupted during the trouble-plagued decades following the end of the Eisenhower administration.</s><s>Assassinations, foreign wars, domestic turmoil, and political scandals occurred without a serious challenge to its democratic order.</s><s>From time to time, political figures, largely from Texas and the other states of the Old Confederacy, made references to the benefits of secession, but their remarks were typically greeted by chuckles elsewhere in the country.</s></p><p><s>Despite its durability, the ensuing decades hardly left American democracy unscathed.</s><s>Given the various crises, how could it be otherwise?</s><s>\"Political trust\" is one of the key elements of a country\\'s political culture (see above).</s><s>In its absence, or in its substantial absence, democratic governments face an array of problems in making and implementing policy decisions.</s><s>For example, this is how Joseph La Palombara depicted the mistrustful Italian citizen during the 1950s:</s></p><p><s>He is isolated into mutually antagonistic sub-groups of the society, basically disinclined to engage in the pragmatic bargaining-the give and take-of a pluralistic democratic polity and at times completely alienated from the political system.</s><s>His attitudes and behavior therefore do not generally contribute to the maintenance and growth of a stable democracy. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b14\">15</ref></s><s> this context, what should we make of the American situation?</s><s>At roughly the same time La Palombara was making his observation about Italian political life, surveys suggested that not only did Americans take pride in their country\\'s political institutions, they also expressed a high level of trust in Washington\\'s intent to \"do the right thing\" in making public policy decisions.</s><s>According to survey evidence from 1958, 73 percent of a national sample of Americans expressed such trust.</s><s>By October 2013, the same question produced a result of 19 percent. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b15\">16</ref></s><s>Nor was this low figure a statistical anomaly.</s><s>Rather, it reflected a long-term trend, one traceable over decades.</s><s>To be sure, there were upward spikes from time to time, but the overall trajectory was one of decline. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">17</ref></s><s>Although the decline was steeper in some years than in others, there was a general loss of trust nonetheless.</s><s>And in comparative terms, the growing American pattern of mistrust has come to resemble those exhibited by French and German publics.</s><s>This popular mistrust hardly occurred overnight.</s><s>As the contributors to Susan Pharr and Robert Putnam\\'s volume Disaffected Democracies note, these trends were clearly noticeable by the 1990s and earlier. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b17\">18</ref></s><s>n addition to the decline in trust, America seems to be losing what Robert Putnam and others refer to as \"social capital.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">19</ref></s><s>The latter constitutes the basis of a civil society, a social environment in which large numbers of the people have sufficient trust in one another to participate in an extensive network of socially concerned groups and organizations.</s><s>Putnam captures this outlook: \"People who trust others are all-around good citizens, and those more engaged in community life are both more trusting and more trustworthy.</s><s>Conversely, the civically disengaged believe themselves to be surrounded by miscreants and feel less constrained to be honest themselves.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b18\">20</ref></s><s>A classic case, one that Putnam and his collaborators mention in another volume, is that of southern Italy.</s><s>The Italian South (or the Mezzogiorno) is a place where interpersonal and political mistrust is so rife that it stifles the kind of civil society many believe is a prerequisite for democratic government.</s></p><p><s>The United States may not have become the Mezzogiorno, but Putnam does report that between 1973-1974 and 1993-1994 Americans showed a dramatic decline in their levels of community and political participation.</s><s>Putnam notes decreases ranging from just over one third fewer people reporting that they attend political events or public meetings, including meetings on local issues such as education, to around 40 percent fewer people reporting being an officer or committee member of a local organization or club. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b19\">21</ref></s><s>They were increasingly, to use Putnam\\'s term, \"bowling alone.\"</s><s>Furthermore, to the extent Americans pay attention to political events, many believe they are becoming polarized.</s><s>During the 1950s, observers of the American political \"scene\" stressed the role of compromise in making the system work.</s><s>Writing in the 1950s, Congressman T. V. Smith equated the ability to compromise with the \"democratic way of life.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">22</ref></s><s>Though some dispute it (e.g., Morris Fiorina), many observers have come to the conclusion that Americans are much less likely to view compromise in a favorable light, much less equate it with the democratic way of life.</s><s>This generalization applies at both the elite level of Washington policy-makers and among members of the public.</s></p><p><s>Within the Washington Beltway, congressmen, particularly those on the Republican right, have now come to perceive themselves as engaged in a virtual war with their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.</s><s>Advocates of an ideology approximating 19th-century social Darwinism, they have come to understand politics as a conflict of principle where one side is right and the other is not only wrong, but tainted with evil. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">23</ref></s><s>\"There appears to be a consensus among scholars and political observers that US political elites have grown more polarized in recent decades.</s><s>Democrats and Republicans in Congress more consistently oppose each other on legislation, the party platforms are more ideologically extreme, and issue activists are more committed to one party or the other.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">24</ref></s><s>The fact that the current American President, Barack Obama, is the first African American elected to that office has likely exacerbated this ideology-driven outlook.</s></p><p><s>Washington, however, is not a \"house without windows,\" a set of institutions cut off from the public at large.</s><s>Rather, Beltway attitudes appear to reflect those expressed by the American electorate in general.</s><s>As Abramowitz and Saunders conclude:</s></p><p><s>Evidence from the American National Election Studies indicates that partisan polarization has increased considerably over the past several decades. .</s><s>.. contrary to the claim that partisan polarization has increased only slightly, there has actually been a dramatic increase in the correlation between party identification and ideological identification since 1972 and especially since 1992 . .</s><s>.. The result of the growing relationship between ideological identification and party identification has been marked increase in ideological polarization between Democratic and Republican identifiers. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">25</ref></s><s>ramowitz and Saunders identify the period of this \"substantial increase in polarization\" between 1972 and 2004.</s><s>Even though these findings were evident across categories of those polled, for the period between 1982 and 2004, the polarization was highest among respondents described as interested, knowledgeable, educated, and part of the voting public.</s><s>Between 2002 and 2004, the percentages of respondents with consistently liberal or conservative stances approached 50 percent among those who were highly knowledgeable and college graduates. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">26</ref></s><s>his political polarization is now reflected in the appearance of distinct political subcultures.</s><s>At an earlier time, social scientists stressed the importance of cross-pressures and overlapping group affiliations in moderating the political outlook of American citizens. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b26\">27</ref></s><s>Social pluralism was healthy and supportive of democratic values in the United States because individuals tended to join intermediary groups (between primary groups and state institutions), whose other members were from a diversity of economic, social, and political backgrounds.</s><s>As a result, citizens came to realize that compromise and moderation were necessary for the group to achieve any of its goals.</s></p><p><s>This picture of American pluralism at work no longer seems to coincide with reality.</s><s>Instead, we have the increasing division of the country into separate subcultures.</s><s>This separation manifests itself in a number of ways.</s><s>For instance, a Pew Center public opinion survey reports a significant and growing difference between Democrats and Republicans over the matter of human evolution.</s><s>Even when controlled for religious affiliation, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to deny natural selection and biological evolution. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">28</ref></s><s>he media offer other compelling examples.</s><s>In earlier decades, most citizens derived their political news from roughly the same outlets.</s><s>This fact was emphasized and compared to the situation in Western Europe.</s><s>In France and Italy, newspapers and other forms of mass communication conveyed different political messages or applied a different spin to the same events.</s><s>In France and Italy, for instance, the communist, socialist, and Christian democratic parties published their own newspapers and weekly news magazines.</s><s>Their messages were intended to convey the parties\\' views to relatively separate audiences of members and followers.</s><s>Today, this mutually isolative means of communication is far less prevalent on the Continent than it once was.</s><s>On the other hand, the situation in the United States has changed radically from the 1950s.</s><s>First, and obviously, there is the Internet, which among other things, permits likeminded people to communicate with one another without the requirement of a common mediator.</s><s>Websites and blogs with particular political outlooks preach to essentially the same choirs of committed partisans.</s><s>About the same may be said in regard to the role of the mass media.</s><s>There are now separate cable television channels attracting distinct audiences of conservatives and liberals.</s><s>Likewise, talkradio commentators, predominantly right-wing, attract substantial audiences of likeminded conservative listeners.</s></p><p><s>The country\\'s electoral map is now divided into \"Red\" and \"Blue\" states or, respectively, strongly Republican and strongly Democratic ones.</s><s>These geographic colorations have the effect of reducing interparty competition, particularly at the level of congressional district balloting.</s></p><p><s>American party politics have changed in other ways as well, ways that make them bear a closer resemblance to their West European counterpartspast and present.</s><s>In the past, such scholars as Seymour Lipset sought to explain the absence of a powerful socialist movement in the United States. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">29</ref></s><s>his continues to be true today.</s><s>But the situation in West Europe has changed in a significant way in recent times.</s><s>It now seems unclear whether, or the extent to which, France, Germany, Spain, and the smaller democracies have major socialist movements.</s><s>Italy, whose communist and socialist parties once were major forces in the country\\'s political life, has undergone a succession of transformations so that their current manifestations bear little resemblance to their predecessors. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">30</ref></s><s>The French Communist Party (PCF) retains its name but has recently abandoned its hammer-and-sickle symbol and has lost most of its electorate.</s><s>Likewise, the French Socialists have retained their historical identity and, in fact, currently hold the country\\'s presidency.</s><s>On the other hand, the party\\'s leadership shows little interest in further nationalization of businesses and the other elements of a coherent anticapitalist policy.</s><s>The German Social Democrats long ago abandoned their commitments to Marxist ideas.</s><s>The German Left, a party whose electoral appeal is strongest in the former East Germany, expresses a continuing commitment to some of these ideas but is at present a minor force in the Bundestag.</s><s>In short, America no longer seems all that exceptional in regard to the weakness of socialism.</s><s>Party politics on the right, in contrast, appears to be thriving on both sides of the Atlantic.</s><s>In the United States, the Tea Party is the most recent manifestation of the country\\'s long history of right-wing populism. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b30\">31</ref></s><s>Claiming to represent the \"real people\" as opposed to economic and political elites, populist movements have attracted substantial support periodically over the course of American history.</s><s>They have frequently been tinged with xenophobia; oftentimes their supporters have appeared challenged and fearful of recent immigrants and newly risen ethnic groups whose presence the populists have found threatening to their status and claims to primacy.</s><s>Characteristically populist movements have been deeply suspicious of America\\'s international involvements and commitments out of fear these would compromise the country\\'s sovereignty-frequently permitting its takeover by foreign elements.</s></p><p><s>The Tea Party is the most recent manifestation in this long trail of rightwing populist movements.</s><s>Seeking to model itself after the insurrectionary episode provided by the Boston Tea Party, the movement appeared following the 2008 election of Barack Obama.</s><s>Its ostensible purpose was to oppose the growing tyranny represented by the federal government with its growing budget deficits.</s><s>Within a short time, however, the movement turned its attention to the alleged threat to individual liberty posed by the Obama administration\\'s health care reform proposals.</s><s>Online and at various public rallies, Tea Party figures conveyed, often in apocalyptic terms, that if enacted into law, the country would propel itself into an irreversible downward spiral.</s><s>Tea Party activists could also be found among the ranks of the \"birthers,\" believing that President Obama had been born in Kenya or Indonesia and was therefore ineligible to serve as the country\\'s chief executive. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b31\">32</ref></s><s>harles Tilly, Sidney Tarrow, and other scholars working in the field of \"contentious politics\" and social movement activity often refer to movement \"entrepreneurs\" as indispensable in galvanizing social and political discontents.</s><s>These entrepreneurs then play crucial roles in sustaining the movement\\'s momentum in its challenge to the status quo. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b32\">33</ref></s><s>n the case of the Tea Party, we are dealing with individuals whose sponsors are often literally entrepreneurs.</s><s>Although it presents itself as a grass-roots movement, the reality is that the party has been sponsored by a variety of conservative political action committees (e.g., Freedom Works, Americans for Prosperity, Heritage Action), headed by prominent former congressmen along with longtime Washington political consultants.</s><s>In turn, they receive financial support from wealthy businessmen.</s><s>At present, a struggle is underway within the Republican Party between Tea Party activists and the GOP\\'s establishment, leaders committed to a more middle-of-the-road course in which the compromise of ideological principles is not regarded as a sin or a compromise with the Devil.</s><s>Right-wing party politics in Western Europe is also undergoing a substantial transformation.</s><s>The Continent now abounds with \"populist\" or \"people\\'s\" parties, who present themselves to voters as opponents of multiculturalism and further immigration to Western Europe from the Third World-the Muslim parts of it especially.</s><s>Rather like the Tea Party in the United States, these \"people\\'s\" parties tend toward what one analyst describes as \"welfare state chauvinism.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">34</ref></s><s>That is, their voters tend to support welfare state benefits for people like themselves but not for the \"undeserving,\" i.e., newcomers and people at the margins of society.</s><s>Then there is the matter of globalization.</s></p><p><s>Far-right parties on both sides of the Atlantic are strong opponents of developments and policies that appear to support the globalization of the economy and, more broadly, society itself.</s><s>Whether or not they are personally globalization \"losers\" whose jobs have been lost or negatively affected by recent economic trends or simply resentful by what seem to be too many compromises with national sovereignty, far-right leaders and followers oppose those institutions thought to be responsible for the momentum toward globalization.</s><s>The European Union, United Nations, and multinational corporations appear to arouse the most ire.</s></p><p><s>New York Times correspondent Andrew Higgins summarizes the situation:</s></p><p><s>In some ways, this is Europe\\'s Tea Party moment-a grass-roots insurgency fired by resentment against a political class that many Europeans see as out of touch.</s><s>The main difference, however, is that Europe\\'s populists want to strengthen, not shrink, government and see the welfare state as an integral part of their national identities. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">35</ref></s><s> should emphasize that leaders of the new right parties have typically gone out of their way to distance themselves from historical fascism.</s><s>(This is less true in Eastern Europe and with Greece\\'s New Dawn party, in particular.)</s><s>In the case of France, the National Front\\'s (FN) leader, Marine LePen, has distanced herself from the anti-Semitism and racism that characterized the FN under her father\\'s longtime leadership.</s><s>And in Italy, neither the Northern League nor the National Alliance (now the Future and Freedom Party) regard with nostalgia the Mussolini era.</s><s>Under the leadership of Gianfranco Fini, virtually all traces of his party\\'s Fascist past have been eliminated from its presentation of self.</s><s>In other words,

force.</s><s>In addition, for right-wing populist movements active on both continents, the open expression of explicitly racist and anti-Semitic ideas has been largely reduced to the margins of acceptable discourse.</s></p><p><s>In short, far-right activity in the United States and Western Europe seem to be heading in a similar direction.</s><s>This similarity of direction is not completely the consequence of exposure to similar stimuli, e.g., Third World immigration.</s><s>Wealthy supporters of free-market economics have created a network of think tanks in both the US and Europe (Latin America as well) to promote their ideas.</s><s>Given their Internet admirers, Frederick Hayek et al. are now able to share their views on a virtually instantaneous basis. <ref type=\"bibr\"

xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>WHY?</head><p><s>At this point, it makes sense to restate our general hypothesis.</s><s>The United States and the countries of Western Europe seem to be converging in an important number of political and economic ways.</s><s>For the most part, this seems to be the result of the United States having lagged behind the European states because of a set of unusual circumstances that no longer prevail.</s><s>What were they?</s></p><p><s>The outcome of World War II produced a set of extraordinary conditions.</s><s>The United States was one of the two victors (along with the Soviet Union).</s><s>Its democratic institutions had remained unscathed; in fact, their resiliency had won the admiration of populations and lawmakers throughout Western Europe.</s><s>In the postwar years, its economy had performed spectacular feats while the war-devastated countries of Europe were the recipients of Marshall Plan aid.</s><s>In the realm of foreign affairs, the United States was the unquestioned leader of the Western alliance in the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union and its East Bloc allies.</s><s>It was likely this abnormal circumstance that produced the civic culture of the Eisenhower years.</s><s>The major countries on the Continent struggled to re-establish democracy and to promote economic recovery.</s><s>These unusual circumstances, with the United States as an outlier, did not last.</s></p><p><s>After their economic recoveries and subsequent expansions, the countries of Western Europe came closer to resembling American performance standards.</s><s>For instance, in an earlier era the United States was renowned for its intergenerational social mobility, the frequency with which the sons and daughters of working-class parents could ascend to middle-class status.</s><s>The evidence now suggests this is no longer the case.</s><s>In fact, OECD data suggest the United States now trails its Western European counterparts in the rate of intergenerational mobility. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b40\">41</ref></s><s>To quote the Economist, \"Back in its Horatio Alger days, America was more fluid than Europe.</s><s>Now it is not.</s><s>Using one-generation measures of social mobility-how much a father\\'s relative income influences that of his adult son-America does half as well as Nordic countries, and about the same as Britain and Italy, Europe\\'s least-mobile places.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">42</ref></s><s>bout the same may be said about income inequality.</s><s>Economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others, calls attention to growing inequality of income in the United States, stressing the degree to which income, and wealth more generally, has been accumulated at the top, while those in the middle and at the bottom have seen wealth and income shrink in both relative and absolute terms.</s><s>Relying on UN data and using the Gini coefficient to measure the extent of income inequality, Stiglitz reports that the level of such inequality in the United States now exceeds that of any country within the European Union. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">43</ref></s><s>He goes on to suggest a number of ways this highly skewed distribution of wealth portends the long-term weakening of democratic beliefs and institutions.</s><s>Or, to put it more explicitly, The fading ideals of American citizenship, civic virtue, social commitment, and civic nationalism are being actively sought once again in the old continent.</s><s>These are values that are supposedly better preserved and rooted in national West European political cultures than in an American society wracked by socio-economic divisions, federal break-up, and extraordinary ethnic and racial fragmentation and conflict. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b43\">44</ref></s><s>other force pushing the United States and Western Europe in the same direction is what Sidney Tarrow describes as the new \"transnational activism.\"</s><s>To the extent that countries on both sides of the Atlantic confront similar problems (e.g., environmental concerns, peace protests, strains on the welfare state), they have given rise to what Tarrow describes as \"rooted cosmopolitans\" and what the writer/journalist Tom Wolfe describes as the \"Mid-Atlantic Man.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b44\">45</ref> By these labels the writers have in mind networks of activists who interact with one another either face-to-face or via social media to develop a common response to issues facing the Western world.</s><s>There is also the problem of Islamic militancy in its Salafist/Jihadist manifestation that draws American and European counterterrorism officers and academics into closer forms of cooperation.</s></p><p><s>What, then, of the claim that the United States and the countries of Western Europe are growing apart?</s><s>The claim is the most persuasive in the realm of foreign and defense policy.</s><s>The American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 offers a strong example of divergence with Western European populations and some governments (Britain excepted) expressing strong opposition to the adventure.</s><s>About the same might be said in regard to the conduct of the war on terrorism more generally (e.g., Guantanamo Bay, the use of waterboarding by CIA agents at \"black sites\").</s><s>There is another side to this story, however.</s><s>Specifically, a large swatch of the American public also objected to the Iraq invasion and subsequently to the use of torture and other violations of international treaty obligations.</s><s>There was a substantial number of mass protests before and during the Iraq War.</s><s>And various American-based \"rooted cosmopolitans\" played major roles in condemning the conflict.</s></p><p><s>The evidence is more compelling when we focus on domestic political and economic patterns over the last half-century.</s><s>What was once a strong case of American exceptionalism from the woes of the Old World has become progressively weaker as the years have passed: the New World has come to resemble

Brown writes, \"What is a microhistory?</s><s>There is no simple answer.</s><s>Indeed the record of the past thirty years indicates that there are several kinds of microhistory, and that the scholars who have led the way have understood it variously (Microhistory and the Post-Modern Challenge: 10).</s><s>That is to say, microhistory cannot be described as a school of thought per se, but rather as a methodology within the broader historical discipline.</s><s>For the purposes of this essay, I shall primarily concern myself with the Italian strain of microhistory for its geographical, ideological, and temporal relevance to Levi\\'s work.</s><s>And indeed, even Italian microhistory demonstrates enough variation such that it is impossible to call it a unified school of thought. 2 Nonetheless, it is possible to address some basic tenets and objectives that hold true across the manifold implementations of microhistory, Italian or otherwise.</s></p><p><s>Microhistory, as the name suggests, demonstrably concerns itself with the scope and scale of a given historical inquiry.</s><s>As Szijártó writes in What is Microhistory?, \"Microhistory is… the intensive historical investigation of a relatively well defined smaller object, most often a single event, or \\'a village community, a group of families, even an individual person\\'\" (4).</s><s>However, a microhistory does not function simply as biography or local(ized) history, nor can its description be relegated to that of a mere case study.</s><s>On the contrary, \"Microhistory… has an objective that is more farreaching than that of a case study: microhistorians always look for the answers to \\'great historical questions\\'… when studying small objects\" (5).</s><s>In other words, microhistory at its best ought to function as an elaborate synecdoche in which a historical actor, community, or event stands to shed light on broader regional and/or global trends.</s><s>In Microhistory and the Histories of Everyday Life Giovanni Levi, one of the founders of Italian microhistory, elaborates on this very point, writing:</s></p><p><s>The unifying principle of all microhistorical research is the belief that microscopic observation will reveal factors previously unobserved… <ref type=\"bibr\">[P]</ref>henomena previously considered to be sufficiently described and understood assume completely new meanings by altering the scale of observation.</s><s>It is then possible to use these results to draw far wider generalizations although the initial observations were made within relatively narrow dimensions (qtd. in Brewer: 97).</s></p><p><s>I will later address just how \"microscopic observation\" positions the historian to make broader claims -specifically in the praxis of Italian microhistory, but for now we can best explain the function of this tenet in terms of the microhistorian\\'s asserted authority.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Brown writes:</head><p><s>By exploring a finite subject exhaustively (though not definitively), the microhistorian commands the evidence on that subject beyond challenge; so within that topic readers learn to accept… [the microhistorian\\'s] authority.</s><s>From this laboriously earned position of authority and trust the microhistorian is positioned to assert broader interpretive statements ( <ref type=\"formula\">16</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Of course, this approach functions on the implicit hope that by meticulously exploring the particular we are better immunized from a misguided generalization.</s></p><p><s>The final tenet of microhistory is the centrality of agency of the subject(s) themselves.</s><s>As Giovanni Levi writes in On Microhistory:</s></p><p><s>[Microhistory] has always centred on the search for a more realistic description of human behaviour, employing an action and conflict model of man\\'s behavior in the world which recognizes his -relative -freedom beyond, though not outside, the constraints of prescriptive and oppressive normative systems (98).</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Similarly, Szijártó writes:</head><p><s>For microhistorians, people who lived in the past are not merely puppets on the hands of great underlying forces of history, but they are regarded as active individuals, conscious actors (5).</s></p><p><s>Perhaps one of the more obvious critiques of a macrohistorical approach is the lack of agency attributed to common people, the masses most often understood as those affected by history, not makers of it.</s><s>Trivellato explains, \"macrohistory draws abundantly, if not exclusively, on secondary sources (ideally, but not always, written in multiple languages).</s><s>Second, macrohistory tends to unfold over many centuries, if not millennia, and often proceeds at considerable speed\" (7).</s><s>In such chronicles even historians of the best intensions must dabble in reductionist narrative strategies to represent those relegated to the lower rungs of society.</s><s>Microhistory, however, seeks \"not to write a history of the exercise of power, but to reconstruct the vision and experiences of those who were its subjects\" (Brewer 100).</s><s>As Brown writes, \"microhistorical work… has sought to \\'recapture\\' the hitherto obscure people and to give them voice.</s><s>That, after all, is one of the purposes of the approach.</s></p><p><s>And by giving voice and agency to obscure people, we may develop respect or even admiration for our subjects\" (13).</s><s>This \"respect\" is largely achieved by the shift of focus or perspective necessitated by microhistorical methodology.</s><s>Zalc and Bruttermann echo this point in Microhistories of the Holocaust, writing, \"The microhistorical level… alters perspectives from the point of view of the victims\" (7).</s></p><p><s>In other words, the focus is oriented on those who are least likely to control the narrative of history.</s><s>Italian microhistory, however, tends to take a slightly more particular approach, especially with regard to the protagonists chosen by its practitioners and, more generally, the objective of the research itself.</s></p><p><s>Though manifold strains of microhistory are, \"motivated by a skepticism that often leads them to doubt the large generalizations of synthesis that, they suspect, may be oversimplified or reductionist\" (Brown: 17), Italian microhistory takes this skepticism as a centerpiece of its praxis.</s><s>As Trivellato observes:</s></p><p><s>Italian microhistorians shared with French and German counterparts the conviction that to reveal phenomena obscured by received wisdom would invalidate the teleology of grand narratives.</s><s>But they strove less to recover the everyday life of ordinary people than to employ the micro-scale of analysis in order to test the validity of macro-scale explanatory paradigms (5).</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Another similarly compelling way to explain this objective of challenging macrohistorical narratives is to recognize that,</head><p><s>A microhistorical approach systematically involves situating oneself within a broader whole and within relationships to other scales in order to understand the context of a particular case, reproducing \"the range of the possible,\" and placing the emphasis on distortion of the general <ref type=\"bibr\">(Zalc &amp; Bruttmann: 4)</ref>.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(qtd. in Trivellato 6)</ref>.</s><s>With this understanding of the particular\\'s potential to shed light on the general, then, we return to Levi and his treatment -both explicit and implicit -of microhistory.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>In other words, Italian microhistory seeks to challenge</head><p><s>As we read in the previously cited passage, Il sistema periodico was intended as a microhistory \"di un mestiere e delle sue sconfitte, vittorie e miserie\" (SP 229), that is, a microhistory of chemistry as a trade.</s><s>Of course, the narrative of Il sistema periodico suggests otherwise -it is not a microhistory of the trade per se, but rather of the trade\\'s practitioner: a chemist.</s><s>The chemist is not only the object of study in Il sistema periodico, however, but also the narrative voice.</s><s>This centrality of the chemist holds true even for the works of the allegorical and fictional sort.</s><s>As we explore Levi\\'s free association of stories with each chapter\\'s title element, we must remain aware that though the narrative voice may change, the author does not.</s><s>Even in the works of fiction -chapters such as \"Piombo,\" \"Mercurio,\" and arguably \"Zolfo,\" and \"Titanio,\" -we are reading a chemist\\'s creative treatment of the periodic table.</s><s>Indeed, it is as if these interludes function as primary source documents, offering windows onto creative endeavors of the microhistorical subject: the chemist, or Levi himself.</s><s>Therefore, we may conclude that Levi\\'s \"microhistory\" is one of a chemist -and importantly, a Jewish chemist subject to the woes of Mussolini\\'s regime.</s><s>The exceptional nature of Levi\\'s chemist emphasizes the ways in which alterity stands to disrupt the norms of a trade\\'s practice.</s><s>As Levi recounts in Il sistema periodico, the predictable professional route was not available to him as a Jew.</s><s>And as Trivellato has observed of Italian microhistories:</s></p><p><s>The protagonists of these global microhistories (as we may call them) are individuals who embody geographical and cultural dislocation.</s><s>Not surprisingly, they often come from minority groups that were bound to be on the move and played a role as linguistic and cultural interpreters; hence the recurrence of Jewish protagonists (16).</s></p><p><s>That said, Levi\\'s ostensible exploration of microhistory goes far beyond this meta-narrative label named in \"Carbonio.\"</s><s>Indeed, some of the more striking microhistorical elements of Levi\\'s work are never explicitly named.</s></p><p><s>In previous passages I discuss microhistory\\'s utility as a tool to challenge macrohistorical narratives through its endeavor to retrieve hitherto understudied or disregarded topics.</s><s>In short, it is a methodology designed to consider the ranges of the possible in the writing of history.</s><s>And without doubt, this intention of retrieving alternative narratives features quite prominently in \"Oro.\"</s><s>Though Levi chronicles his short-lived tenure as a partisan and his subsequent capture by Fascist forces in this chapter, the greatest revelations gleaned from these experiences have little to do with strategic insight or tactical prowess.</s><s>Rather, Levi\\'s most notable realizations concern themselves with altered perspectives and the construction of alternative narratives.</s><s>Moreover, it cannot go unmentioned that the opening of \"Oro\" itself anticipates Levi\\'s ultimate microhistory: that of the carbon atom found in the final chapter of Il sistema periodico.</s><s>Speaking of his time in Milan, Levi writes of his younger self:</s></p><p><s>[F]antasticavo di scrivere la saga di un atomo di carbonio, per far capire ai popoli la poesia solenne, nota solo ai chimici, della fotosintesi clorofilliana: ed in fatto l\\'ho poi scritta, ma molti anni più tardi, ed è la storia con cui questo libro si conclude (131).</s></p><p><s>In this passage we find Levi imagining how a single atom could stand to shed light on the chemical process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugar and oxygen: photosynthesis.</s><s>Indeed, Levi\\'s narrative of photosynthesis prefigures his evolving sensitivity to the perspective from which history is written.</s><s>As he writes of himself and his companions, \"[n]el giro di poche settimane ognuno di noi maturò, più che in tutti i vent\\'anni precedenti\" (133).</s><s>It is with this maturity that Levi develops a more subtle understanding of the past, namely by way of a burgeoning skepticism of his education under Fascist rule.</s><s>He writes of his newly-found teachers:</s></p><p><s>Uscirono dall\\'ombra uomini che il fascismo non aveva piegati, avvocati, professori ed operai, e riconoscemmo in loro i nostri maestri, quelli di cui avevamo inutilmente cercato fino allora la dottrina nella Bibbia, nella chimica, in montagna.</s><s>Il fascismo li aveva ridotti al silenzio per vent\\'anni, e ci spiegarono che il fascismo non era soltanto un malgoverno buffonesco e improvvido, ma il negatore della giustizia (133).</s><s>Much akin to the practitioners of microhistory, Levi is favoring the voices of those relegated to positions of alterity within their own communities, of those hitherto silenced in the shadow of Fascism.</s><s>Proffering a unique perspective that offers insight into the plurality of experiences under Fascism, Levi elevates a narrative of what would later be considered an \"exceptional normal.\"</s></p><p><s>Effectively, he is challenging the impression of a homogeneous society under Mussolini\\'s regime.</s><s>Speaking of this marginalized group that had exited from the shadows, Levi writes: \"Ci dissero che la nostra insofferenza beffarda non bastava… ma non ci insegnarono come si fabbrica una bomba, né come si spara un fucile\" (133).</s><s>Indeed, Levi\\'s newfound teachers understood that to resist the \"menzogna sistematica e calcolata\" (133) of the Fascist regime demanded a resistance that went beyond physical force.</s></p><p><s>Rather, resistance required an augmentation of consciousness, of historical awareness.</s><s>He continues:</s></p><p><s>Ci parlavano di sconosciuti: Gramsci, Salvemini, Gobetti, i Rosselli; chi erano?</s><s>Esisteva dunque una seconda storia, una storia parallela a quella che il liceo ci aveva somministrata dall\\'alto?</s><s>In quei pochi mesi convulsi cercammo invano di ricostruire, di ripopolare il vuoto storico dell\\'ultimo ventennio, ma quei nuovi personaggi rimanevano \"eroi\", come Garibaldi e Nazario Sauro, non avevano spessore né sostanza umana (134).</s></p><p><s>Coyly, Levi openly wonders if perhaps there exists a second history -an alternative to that which dominated his own formal education.</s><s>He answers this question implicitly through his depiction of those who rejected Fascist society and the sconosciuti of whom they spoke, successfully undermining the narrative set forward by Mussolini dall\\'alto.</s><s>In essence, these passages function as a doubling of microhistorical narrative: on the first level, the young Levi offers an account of those who experienced acute forms of alterity under Fascism, the \"uomini che il fascismo non aveva piegati.\"</s><s>On the second level, these men disseminate narratives of the sconosciuti, the unknown actors from the time before the war.</s></p><p><s>Beyond these narratives, however, there remains an extratextual element worthy of consideration: the author.</s><s>Indeed, one could reasonably argue that these passages are not only a doubling, but a tripling of microhistorical narrative when one recognizes that beyond the extant strata of the narrative there remains the creator of it: the authorial Levi who writes of the young Levi and his band of partisan compatriots, themselves persons who occupy the As Levi laments the lack of human substance attributed to the characters of his education, he implicitly critiques the reductive nature of certain historical accounts, suggesting that truth content is diminished when we omit complicating factors for the sake of a clear narrative.</s><s>This desire to problematize historical narrative evokes the slogan for microhistory once proposed by Jacques Revel, \"why make things simple when one can make them complicated?\"</s><s>(qtd. in G. <ref type=\"bibr\">Levi On Microhistory: 114)</ref>.</s><s>That is to say, why offer a simple historical narrative when one is equipped to relate a narrative of far more nuanced, if not outright contradictory factors?</s><s>Beyond the problematization of history through the restoration of alternative narratives or the spaces of the possible <ref type=\"bibr\">(Zalc &amp; Bruttmann: 4)</ref>, it is moreover feasible to read these passages through the lens of another key microhistorical trope: the rejection of rhetoric.</s><s>After all, a pronounced disdain for rhetoric is a key characteristic of Italian microhistory.</s><s>Trivellato writes:</s></p><p><s>In highlighting the Italian character of this circle [of microhistorians],</s></p><p><s>[Edoardo] Grendi noted the existence of a common \"style\" marked by a strong theoretical awareness and by a rejection of idealism in philosophy, ideological dualism in politics, as well as rhetorical pomposity and grand syntheses in historical writing (5).</s></p><p><s>Certainly, this rejection of idealist philosophy and rhetorical pomposity easily accounts for microhistorians\\' skepticism of macrohistorical narratives.</s><s>In certain terms, it is the implicit foundation of microhistory\\'s role in challenging such versions of history.</s><s>And clearly, it bears a resemblance to Levi\\'s own rejection of rhetoric.</s><s>As readers ought remember, Levi\\'s skepticism of the Fascist historical narrative prescribed dall\\'alto is by no means the only instance in which Levi expresses his wariness of rhetoric.</s></p><p><s>In the chapter \"Zinco,\" Levi writes of Professor P\\'s (whom Levi unabashedly holds in high esteem) disdain for rhetoric.</s><s>Levi contends that it was solely by virtue of his rejection of rhetoric that he remained immune from the lures of Fascism -\"per questo, e solo per questo, era anche antifascista\" (SP 23).</s><s>Moreover, this insistence This emphasis on the intellectual involvement of the reader dovetails with an oft overlooked aspect of microhistory: the reader\\'s role in the composition and reception of microhistorical narratives.</s><s>Giovanni Levi observes that the reader is never a tabula rasa (On Microhistory: 109), and thus ought not be treated as such.</s><s>As a result, microhistory endeavors to eschew narrative strategies that stand to obfuscate the writer\\'s methodology, allowing the reader to engage with the processes of research itself.</s><s>G. Levi continues:</s></p><p><s>[A] characteristic [of microhistory] is that of incorporating into the main body of the narrative the procedures of research itself, the documentary limitations, techniques of persuasion and interpretive constructions.</s><s>This method clearly breaks with the traditional assertive, authoritarian form of discourse adopted by historians who present reality as objective (110).</s></p><p><s>Much akin to Levi\\'s cherished classroom experience described in \"Zinco,\" the emphasis in microhistorical narrative is not on the conclusions yielded, but rather the process by which conclusions may be gleaned.</s><s>Borrowing from P. Levi\\'s language, microhistory, like \"la chimica di P.\" does not endeavor to offer \"la chiave del Vero\" (SP 30); instead, it seeks to illuminate methodologies by which a series of truths may be deciphered.</s><s>The readers must be privy to the process of methodological development rather than have it prescribed for (or hidden from) them.</s><s>Ginzburg, too, echoes this point in \"Microhistory: Two or Three Things That I Know about It.\"</s><s>He writes:</s></p><p><s>[Italian microhistory is] based on the definite awareness that all phases through which research unfolds are constructed and not given: the identification of the object and its importance; the elaboration of the categories through which it is analyzed; the criteria of proof; the stylistic and narrative forms by which the results are transmitted to the reader (32).</s></p><p><s>The point of this praxis -of delineating the methodological processes -is to keep the reader fully apprised of the inner workings and potential limitations of the microhistorian\\'s argument.</s><s>It is the antithesis of \"the traditional assertive, authoritarian form of discourse adopted by historians who present reality as objective\" and the ostensible methodological solution to P. Levi\\'s critique of history offered dall\\'alto.</s><s>As G. Levi contends, it is by virtue of this narrative strategy that, \"[t]he reader [of microhistory] is involved in a sort of dialogue and participates in the whole process of constructing the historical argument\" (On Microhistory: 110).</s><s>Of course, this \"dialogue\" is somewhat of an illusion -after all, the reader cannot interpose her words in the text itself.</s><s>Rather, the reader realizes her agency in the differentiation and deciphering of fact and opinion.</s><s>Though she may not be a co-author in the text, she is the judge of its content, of its efficacy of argument.</s><s>To rewrite P. Levi\\'s well-cited words from our perspective as readers of microhistory: i giudici siamo noi.</s></p><p><s>Beyond these parallels, perhaps the most spectacular microhistorical element of Il sistema periodico is the (microhi)story of the carbon atom.</s><s>We have already learned some of the ostensible intentions behind the composition of this episode, namely through Levi\\'s own words in \"Oro.\"</s><s>As I have previously discussed, microhistory at its best functions as an elaborate synecdoche in which the analysis of a hitherto overlooked subject illuminates broader historical trends.</s><s>And that is precisely what Levi does in the episode from \"Carbonio\": he seeks to elucidate the process of photosynthesis through the documentation of one of its smallest parts, a single carbon atom.</s><s>This intention well mirrors both the objective and composition of microhistorical works, albeit in a fictionalized account.</s><s>At its most ambitious -and arguably its most presumptuous -however, microhistory ventures to offer yet a broader commentary by way of its findings.</s><s>\"As Lepore argues, microhistorians often believe that the examination of their case can be \\'an allegory for… the culture as a whole.\\'</s><s>They treat individuals as a means of \\'explaining the culture,\\' and not in order to celebrate the singularity of their subject\" (Brown: 14).</s><s>Clearly, Lepore is not lauding this practice; he is merely acknowledging its occasional incidence in the realms of the microhistorical methodology.</s><s>That said, it is worth exploring Levi\\'s own forays into allegory through his account of the carbon atom.</s></p><p><s>As readers ought reasonably suspect, it is unlikely that Levi included the chronicle of \"Carbonio\" simply to make people understand the \"solemn poetry of photosynthesis.\"</s><s>Certainly, Levi does achieve this objective in offering new perspectives on This passage offers some notable clues to Levi\\'s true intentions for this unorthodox conclusion to his not-quite autobiography.</s></p><p><s>Of course, the time and place to which Levi is referring is the above cited episode recounted in \"Oro.\"</s><s>What is noteworthy here, however, is that the emphasis is not on communicating the process of photosynthesis, but rather on carbon as the element of life -and Levi\\'s own worth as a life.</s><s>Photosynthesis, though referenced and candidly cited several times in the narrative, serves primarily as a vehicle -as the literal and metaphorical point of entry to the true concern at hand: life.</s><s>As every atom of carbon \"entra e rientra nel ciclo della vita, attraverso la porta stretta della fotosintesi\" (236), so too do the carbon atom\\'s interactions in photosynthesis function as Levi\\'s narrative device to compose an allegory of life.</s><s>With this in mind, it is possible to read the final sentence of Il sistema periodico with new clarity.</s><s>As Levi describes the final phase of the carbon atom\\'s journey into a human cell:</s></p><p><s>Questa cellula appartiene ad un cervello, e questo è il mio cervello, di me che scrivo, e la cellula in questione, ed in essa l\\'atomo in questione, è addetta al mio scrivere, in un gigantesco minuscolo gioco che nessuno ha ancora descritto (SP 237).</s></p><p><s>From carbon comes both the primo sogno letterario and the organic, mechanical ability to realize it.</s><s>In light of the allegory woven throughout this chapter, however, it is moreover possible to appreciate implications of this passage that far transcend Levi\\'s immediate experience.</s><s>With the understanding that this saga of the carbon atom is intended as a synecdoche for all life, an ostensible significance of the gigantesco minuscolo gioco che nessuno ha ancora descritto comes into clear focus.</s><s>It too is life: gigantic because it is everything, minuscule because we can intuit its elements down to the atomic level.</s></p><p><s>Remarkably, it seems as though Levi implements all of the fundamental tenets of Italian microhistory in Il sistema periodico, a consideration that offers a far richer reading of the text.</s><s>Then The composition of Il sistema periodico on the cusp of Italian microhistory\\'s emergence is a co-incidence that has remained largely uninterrogated, though not unnoticed.</s><s>Indeed, it was Ginzburg himself who first remarked on Levi\\'s spectacular timing, writing on the genesis of Italian microhistory, Microhistory, microhistoria, microhistoire:from which of these independent traditions did the Italian microstoria derive?</s><s>On the strictly terminological level… the answer would seem to be clear: from the French microhistoire.</s><s>I am thinking first of all of the splendid translation by Italo Calvino published in 1967 of Les Fleurs bleues [I fiori blu]; second, of a passage in Primo Levi in which, to the best of my knowledge, the word microstoria appears in Italian for the first time in an autonomous manner (\"Microhistory: Two or Three Things\" 15).</s></p><p><s>The passage to which Ginzburg is referring, of course, is that of \"Carbonio\" in Il sistema periodico.</s><s>He continues:</s></p><p><s>Primo Levi probably encountered it [the word microhistory] in Calvino\\'s Italian translation, which he must have checked against Queneau\\'s original text.</s><s>Knowledge of the translation of Les Fleurs bleues seems certain, given the close relationship that united <ref type=\"bibr\">Levi to Calvino (15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>So it seems that microstoria found its place in the Italian vernacular by way of two literary novels: first by translation <ref type=\"bibr\">(Calvino, 1967)</ref>, and then by appropriation <ref type=\"bibr\">(Levi, 1975)</ref>.</s><s>The story, however, does not end here.</s><s>As Ginzburg recounts:</s></p><p><s>Shortly after its [microhistory\\'s] appearance in The Periodic Table, the word microhistory entered historical usage, losing, as often happens, its original negative connotation. 5</s><s>Giovanni Levi… was undoubtedly behind this transposition (15).</s><s>As the adage goes, the plot thickens.</s><s>I have previously noted that Giovanni Levi, like Carlo Ginzburg, is widely recognized as one of the key proponents of Italian microhistory.</s><s>What I have yet to address, however, is that he was a cousin of Primo Levi <ref type=\"bibr\">(Ginzburg: 15)</ref>. 6</s><s>Lamentably, there exists paltry record of a relationship in adulthood.</s><s>However, it does appear that Giovanni Levi did in fact begin using the term microstoria shortly after the publication of Il sistema periodico.</s><s>As Ginzburg attests: \"I believe that I heard of microhistory for the first time from Giovanni <ref type=\"bibr\">Levi in 1977</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Levi in or 1978</ref>, and I adopted this previously unheard-of word without asking what it meant literally\" (10).</s><s>Then again, this timeline proffered by Ginzburg is somewhat perplexing: after all, Il formaggio e i vermi, the exemplum of Italian microhistory, was published in 1976.</s><s>How is this possible?</s><s>In the following passages I hope to untangle the curious and complicated origin of Italian microhistory, revealing an intellectual landscape in post-war Italy that sought to reinvent the portrayal of human experience.</s></p><p><s>In the case of Italian microhistory, the methodology predates the label.</s><s>Osvaldo Raggio writes in Treccani:</s></p><p><s>L\\'idea [di microstoria] era forse nell\\'aria, come ha tentato di dimostrare Carlo <ref type=\"bibr\">Ginzburg (1994)</ref>; ma in Italia questa nuova tendenza storiografica è comparsa per la prima volta sotto la voce \\'microanalisi storica\\' in alcuni lavori di Edoardo Grendi (L\\'antropologia economica, 1972) e di Giovanni Levi (Famiglie contadine nella Liguria del Settecento, 1973) all\\'inizio degli anni Settanta.</s></p><p><s>Beyond the texts delineated above, Ginzburg\\'s I benandanti: stregoneria e culti agrari tra Cinquecento e Seicento (1966) similarly illustrates this burgeoning methodology, effectively anticipating the style of argumentation later realized in Il formaggio e i vermi <ref type=\"bibr\">(Trivellato)</ref>.</s><s>In light of these earlier publications, it appears that microanalisi storica was the precursor to Italian microhistory in the historical discipline.</s><s>Calvino\\'s translation, P. Levi\\'s appropriation, and G. Levi\\'s implementation of the term microstoria, then, were merely events that contributed to a rebranding of an already extant methodology.</s><s>Furthermore, this methodology was preceded by yet another documentary concern in Italy following the Second World War.</s><s>And remarkably, the true origins of Italian microhistory appear to reside not in the written word, but on the silver screen.</s><s>Angela Dalle Vacche writes:</s></p><p><s>Before and after the fascist period, Italian cinema splits between two major impulses (the recording of the daily and a fascination with the historical), two scales (the documentary and the operatic) and two allegorical extremes (the anonymous and the monumental) (Review of Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism 120).</s></p><p><s>These dichotomies well mirror several essential features of modern microhistorical praxis.</s><s>The bifurcated impulse to document the quotidian and reevaluate the historical prefigures the dialogue between micro and macro analyses essential to microhistorical study.</s><s>Or, as Brown observes, \"Like ethnographers, they use the micro study to discover variations in general patterns of behavior, or to reveal larger [historical] patterns\" (4).</s><s>The two scales of the documentary and operatic reflect the narrative interplay of microhistory.</s><s>As Ginzburg writes of his own book, \"[Il formaggio e i vermi] does not restrict itself to the reconstruction of an individual event; it narrates it\" (23).</s><s>Finally, the two allegorical extremes of the anonymous and the monumental anticipate the paradox of Grendi\\'s \"exceptional normal.\"</s><s>Indeed, these dichotomies that so closely resemble the intellectual and ideological trappings of microhistory formed the backbone of cinema\\'s answer to Fascism: Italian neorealism.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Shiel writes in Italian Neorealism: Rebuilding the Cinematic City:</head><p><s>Neorealism is [...] a historically-# and culturally-specific manifestation of the general aesthetic quality known as \"realism\" which is characterized by a disposition to the ontological truth of the physical, visible world.</s><s>(1) 7</s></p><p><s>This \"realism\" captured in films such as Roma, città aperta <ref type=\"bibr\">(1945</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">( ), Paisà (1946))</ref>, Ladri di biciclette <ref type=\"bibr\">(1948)</ref>, and La terra trema <ref type=\"bibr\">(1948)</ref> attempted to rewrite the hitherto narrative monopoly of Fascist rhetoric and propaganda, constituting \"a part of a larger post-war cultural movement intent on ending the ideological and aesthetic obfuscation of real, everyday life…and as a way of recuperating the harsh experiences of the Second World War\" (Brewer 101).</s></p><p><s>As is evidenced in several early neorealist films, it both reflected a paradigm shift in the collective Italian psyche and established the ideological heritage of Italian microhistory.</s></p><p><s>The first major film released in the wake of the Second World War, Rossellini\\'s Roma, città aperta, foregrounds several seminal features that would form the basis of Italian microhistory.</s><s>First and foremost, Rossellini sidesteps the bombastic grand-narratives of Allied victory to focus on a group that had occupied a position of alterity for much of the war: partisan fighters.</s><s>As Marcus has commented, \"The neorealist resolve \\'to plant the camera in the midst of real life, in the midst of all that struck our astonished eyes\\' enabled filmmakers and their audiences to see an Italy that Mussolini had concealed for two full decades\" (xiv).</s><s>Not only are the protagonists partisan fighters, however.</s><s>They moreover include those generally portrayed as neutral or inconsequential in retellings of history: women and children.</s><s>And as Brewer writes, \"all [schools of microhistory] concern themselves with the lives, beliefs and practices of those who had previously been \\'hidden\\' from history\" (90).</s><s>Indeed, it is similarly worthy of note that even though the partisans portrayed end on the \"victorious side\" of the war, several of the key protagonists do not survive Nazi occupation to bear witness to their own experiences. 8</s><s>Moreover, the temporal scale of Roma, città aperta focuses on a relatively short period of the war.</s><s>Marcus writes:</s></p><p><s>The term \"chronicle\" has been applied again and again to describe the experiences of a group of Resistance fighters, set in Rome between the onset of the Nazi occupation in September 1943 and the Allied liberation of the city in June 1944 <ref type=\"bibr\">(Marcus: 35)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Perhaps most notably, however, Roma, città aperta exhibits a rejection of rhetoric that would later become central to the \"Italian character\" of Italian microhistory described by Grendi.</s></p><p><s>Marcus opens her first case study in Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism with a telling indictment delivered by the Gestapo chief, Bergmann, to the imprisoned Manfredi: \"You Italians, whatever party you belong to, are all addicted to rhetoric.</s><s>But I\\'m quite sure that you will see things my way before dawn\" (33).</s><s>She continues:</s></p><p><s>Bergmann is proven twice wrong, both in his certainty that Manfredi will break under torture and in his characterization of all Italians as creatures of rhetoric whose deeds will never match their extravagant promises… <ref type=\"bibr\">[and]</ref> it extends to all of Fascist Italy, whose penchant for rhetoric was so well exploited by that archjournalist and manipulator of headlines, Benito Mussolini (33).</s></p><p><s>Marcus has remarked that \"neorealism became the repository of partisan hopes for social justice in the postwar Italian state\" (xiv), and a key facet of realizing this social justice meant prioritizing truth content over rhetorical flourish.</s><s>In response to this shift in narrative priorities, neorealist cinema has been characterized as \"an aesthetics of rejection\" (qtd. in Shiel 2).</s><s>This observation underscores a paradigm shift regarding the role of rhetoric in narrative and visual witness bearing and storytelling.</s><s>Indeed, Rossellini\\'s prophecy seems to have come to fruition.</s><s>The rejection of rhetoric is manifest in P. Levi\\'s work and microhistorical methodology.</s><s>Moreover, the commitment to anti-rhetoricalrealism is apparent in the post-war work of \"writers such as Elio Vittorini and Italo Calvino, photographers such as Mario De Biasi and Frederico Patellani, and… architects such as Ludovico Quaroni and Mario Ridolfi\" (Shiel: 2).</s><s>Yet, Rossellini\\'s cinematic reflection of Italy\\'s ideological reinvention post-Fascism and anticipation of microhistorical methodology does not end with Roma, città aperta.</s></p><p><s>Released in 1946, Rossellini\\'s Paisà similarly captured the burgeoning zeal to reclaim and rewrite the Italian narrative of the Second World War.</s><s>Indeed, Brewer has argued that, \"Rossellini\\'s Paisà was one of the first works of Italian microhistory\" (101).</s><s>As I have previously noted, Italian microhistory seeks to challenge the reductionist teleologies characteristic of macrohistorical narratives.</s><s>This is certainly the case in Paisà, of which Brewer writes:</s></p><p><s>Rossellini\\'s film takes one grand narrative, the progressive liberation of Italy by the British and Americans in 1943-4, which frames six stories set in different regions of Italy from Sicily to the Po Valley.</s><s>The stories reduce the conflict to a human scale, yet in doing so they undercut or rewrite the positive story of liberation, showing how time\\'s arrow is often diverted (101).</s></p><p><s>Indeed, Rossellini systematically problematizes the narrative of the Allied invasion and subsequent liberation, exposing the quotidian toil, hardship, and confusion that came with the presence of multiple occupying armies.</s><s>Beyond the challenging of macrohistorical narrative, however, Paisà furthermore establishes its own documentary limitations through its camera work, anticipating the strategy taken by microhistorians to render the reader active in the process of narrative construction.</s><s>Brewer writes:</s></p><p><s>The viewer is made conscious of cinematic artifice -conscious of the presence of the camera -but also aware of Rossellini\\'s curious sense of detachment.</s><s>Throughout there is a tension between veracity and verisimilitude, between the patterns of everyday life and the forces of larger history (101).</s></p><p><s>Again, the emphasis is placed on the process by which conclusions may be gleaned, not on conclusions yielded, a practice in direct opposition to baseless rhetoric.</s><s>This episode reflects Ginzburg\\'s comment that, \"[the] anomaly implies the norm (whereas the opposite is not true)\" (\"Some Queries Addressed to Myself\" 93).</s><s>Moreover, Ladri di biciclette exploits the perceptual tension between the particular trials of the Ricci family and the general state of economic strife in Italy.</s><s>For example, as viewers sympathize with the family\\'s sacrifice of dowry bedsheets for a bicycle, a camera-pan of the pawn shop shows many more bedsheets likely forfeited under similar circumstances.</s></p><p><s>In microhistorical terms, the entire narrative of Ladri di biciclette functions as what would later be called an \"exceptional normal\" case.</s><s>Viewers are reoriented through the particular case of the Ricci family to draw broader conclusions on the state of Italian society.</s><s>Scola has remarked that, \"Neorealism, as the artistic expression of a historical period represents an important revolutionary moment, not only of cinema, but of Italian thought\" (qtd. in Marcus xv).</s><s>Indeed, this seems not to be an overstatement.</s><s>The end of the Second World War saw not only regime change but the emergence of new authors and auteurs.</s><s>Notwithstanding the fact that Italian neorealism may appear somewhat far removed from the heyday of microhistorical publications, 9 the early microhistorians were indeed part of the same milieu.</s><s>In \"Some Queries Addressed to Myself\" Ginzburg writes:</s></p><p><s>I decided three things: that I wanted to be a historian; that I wanted to study witchcraft trials; that what I wanted to study was not the persecution of witchcraft, but the victims of persecution -the women and men accused of being witches and sorcerers…But there was another element, which I did not realize until many years later: in the emotional identification with the victims of persecution, and in the impulse to study them, there was an unconscious projection of my Jewish identity, which the persecution [during the Second World War] had reinforced (90) 10 .</s></p><p><s>Giovanni Levi acknowledges similar formative experiences in \"Il piccolo, il grande e il piccolo.\"</s><s>Io penso che un altro elemento della mia formazione abbia contato moltissimo nei miei rapporti con la microstoria: quello che mi stupiva di più è come io abbia avuto delle esperienze che non mi avevano stupito, esperienze che raccontate dagli storici sono stupefacenti -per esempio la guerra, il fascismo, l\\'antisemitismo, ecc.</s><s>( <ref type=\"formula\">216</ref>)</s></p><p><s>Though it has been alluded to across popular and scholarly writings, it bears repeating that many of the neorealists had experienced life at the margins of society during Fascism.</s><s>\"\\'We made Open City,\\' wrote Sergio Amidei in 1947, \\'under the impression, the suggestion, and the influence of what we had just lived through\\'\" (qtd. in <ref type=\"bibr\">Marcus 36)</ref>.</s><s>And the same can be said of the early microhistorians like G. Levi and Ginzburg: in writing histories of those relegated to the margins of society, they were really telling stories of their own alterity.</s><s>Chang has written that \"one important yet overlooked approach to reading Il sistema periodico is as testimonial literature about the history of Otherness in twentieth-century Italy -a history that has for the most part gone ignored\" (\"Chemical Contaminations\" 544).</s><s>While this is certainly true, I hope this essay demonstrates that Il sistema periodico not only alludes to a history of Otherness in twentiethcentury Italy.</s><s>It moreover represents an important moment in the progression of popular and scholarly representations of alterity.</s><s>noteS 1 Mirna Cicioni writes of Levi\\'s citation, \"Il secondo verso del primo canto del poema satirico La Pucelle d\\'Orléans di Voltaire (Vous m\\'ordonnez de célébrer des saints: / Ma voix est foible, et même un peu profane) non è tradotto, e la fonte della citazione resta ignota alla maggior parte dei lettori, a meno che essi non leggano la relativa nota dell\\'autore nell\\'edizione scolastica o facciano ricerche elettroniche.</s><s>Ma anche i lettori incapaci di risalire alla fonte, vedendosi direttamente interpellati dalle prime parole, sanno che attraverso il terzo interlocutore, chiunque questi sia, l\\'io narrante parla a loro, e riconoscono la funzione autoironica della citazione, che sembra svalutare tutta la rete dei significati (storici, autobiografici, scientifici, letterari) del Sistema Periodico prima dell\\'ultimo volo narrativo e autoreferenziale\" (\"Parole esportate\" 59). 2 Trivellato writes in \"Is There a Future for Italian Microhistory in the Age of Global History?\", \"By everyone\\'s account, Italian microhistorians never amounted to a unified school of thought\" (5).</s></p><p><s>3 Though Einaudi publishes Il sistema periodico in 1975, Levi offers 1970 as the year of composition of \"Carbonio.\"</s></p><p><s>4 According to Brown, \"Effectively, the term \\'microhistory\\' was invented by Italian historians of the early modern period, first winning international acclaim with Carlo Ginzburg\\'s The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller\" \"Microhistory and the Post-Modern Challenge\" 11.</s><s>As I will demonstrate later in the text, however, this history of the term \"microhistory\" is reductive. 5</s><s>The word \"microhistory\" floated around in multiple languages before entering into Italian.</s><s>However, it generally referred to local and biographical histories that were decidedly regarded as unserious .</s></p><p><s>6 Anissimov claims that G. and P.

<p><s>project calls for a critical examination of the concept of transition in its links to neoliberal ideology and its rejection of the communist past.</s><s>I argue that the works in the project question what futures were possible after the fall of communism in Romania.</s><s>I do this by countering the notion of transition as a blanket ideological term with local accounts on gender and precarity.</s><s>As the idea of \"transition\" is part of a time and space often covered by another problematic term \"postcommunism,\" I read Richardson\\'s work as a critical response to two aspects that have affected Romania during this period: namely an instrumentalized view of time and space, and a prescribed image of the postcommunist subject as always needing to look ahead to integration into neoliberal economic, political, and military structures.</s><s>Richardson uses moving images to assess these two aspects and to understand the Romanian context as it presented in 2008, during an unfolding global financial crash.</s><s>Critically revisiting both transition and postcommunism and their consequences in the recent past is necessary as they have strongly shaped the contemporary imagination.</s></p><p><s>Richardson approaches the task from a self-critical position, between memory and distant observation, and produces documents which neither vilify nor nostalgically gloss over recent history.</s><s>This becomes an act of opposition to the dominant blend of anticommunist, neoliberal narratives.</s><s>Her decision to return to Romania (she was an Austrian and then U.S. immigrant during the Ceau ș escu regime) and make these works collectively was based on her perception of the possibility for radical engagement with the \"postcommunist condition\".</s><s>The necessity to investigate recent history in Romania was critical to her nuanced position towards postcommunism often imagined generically as a space-time that occurred \"after\" communism.</s><s>With Richardson\\'s personal position as a female-identifying immigrant and her acknowledgement of her role as outsider-insider, these reflexive investigations become worthy of re-reading and recognizing (for their virtues and flaws) in a contemporary context.</s></p><p><s>In Romania, the violence and urgency of the 1989 revolution was perpetuated through repetition of televised images well into the next decade.</s><s>At the time, an anxious and threatening state loomed; while not officially a state of emergency anymore, it still acted like one a year later, notably through violent interventions against democratic protesters and targeted racial attacks against Roma during the events of 13-15 June 1990.</s><s>Against the backdrop of an anticommunist narrative of transition, these threats contributed to the diminishing general trust in activism and eventually to a generalized cynicism of the postcommunist experience.</s><s>The recuperation of the dark space-times of modernity, shaped by violence and shrouded in elitism and divisive politics (worker vs. intellectual), is a context specific to Romania, and the necessity to address postcommunism critically stemmed from it.</s><s>Here the idea of suppressing or forgetting the communist past took shape in relation to a right-wing ideology that blended nationalism, anticommunism, and transition as a movement towards development and integration.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the 1989 revolution and the events of 1990 continue to hold intense power over the Romanian context.</s><s>Thus, there is a need to investigate these events in key moments: after Romania\\'s integration into the European Union in 2007 and the economic crisis of 2008, but also, I argue, in the present configuration of racism against refugees, rising Christian Orthodox-infused homophobia and heteronormativity, and increasing nationalist and xenophobic discourse and attacks.</s></p><p><s>Following the revolution, privatization, foreign investment and global capital brought Romania, imagined as sedentary during communism, into \"progressive\" forward movement, transitioning into economic, political and military structures like NATO and the EU.</s><s>Local mayors proclaimed the transition officially over.</s><s>However, no one proclaimed postcommunism over.</s><s>Few addressed how the transition had affected workers, women, and Roma.</s><s>Small artistic groups like D-Media and h.arta produced a series of independent projects; they addressed local coordinates, opened links between art, media and activism, and also questioned their own position of speech.</s><s>Richardson\\'s work was one of these necessary responses, aiming to produce compositions with moving images, which help us to rethink the space-time of postcommunist neoliberal Romania.</s><s>Revisiting these events and histories is an act of interrogating imagination, an attempt to critically assess the postcommunist condition retrospectively, looking for renewed vocabularies for the contemporary moment to emerge.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>In Transit</head><p><s>In Transit is one of the three works of the Commonplaces of Transition project by Richardson.</s><s>The project reflects on changes in the two decades prior to their making.</s><s>I am reading them as part of the struggle to not let the \"postcommunist condition\" be fixed in recent history solely as an economic transition to democracy and neoliberal capitalism.</s><s>My interest lies in how these works contribute to decoupling this period of transition from dominant anticommunist views.</s><s>Commonplaces of Transition, I argue, critically assesses Romanian postcommunism and contests the imagination of transition as a forward movement and as a way of instrumentalizing space-time for political purposes.</s></p><p><s>Richardson\\'s work with the D-Media collective <ref type=\"bibr\">[1]</ref> was based on independent audiovisual production, activist actions, and the making of open source content.</s><s>Richardson believed that the concepts of \"transition\" and of \"postcommunism\" needed critical re-assessment, starting with the lived experience of transition in the local Romanian context.</s><s>The Commonplaces project declared its investment in opening up \"a critical dialogue about the meaning of transition and other alternatives to simply \\'catching up\\' with the global market\" and was dedicated to \"represent[ing] postcommunism from the inside.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">[2]</ref></s><s>The use of the term \"commonplaces\" in the title implied its double meaning, as \"common places\" in the sense of geography or territory, and as \"commonplaces,\" deriving from an ideological understanding of transition.</s><s>In its first meaning, it alluded to views in which Romania fell somewhere in the middle in a first, second and third world ordering, dictated by the imperial role of the West and the redistribution of power in the remapped geopolitical territories after the Cold War, as center and periphery.</s><s>The middle or buffer position was fitting with a longer historical positioning of the Romanian territory between empires (Ottoman, Roman, Austro-Hungarian).</s><s>Furthermore, this in-between was easily aligned with a commonplace neoliberal idea that if transition was indeed happening, it should be towards the \"first world,\" towards the West as ideal of development.</s><s>This understanding of transition as integration into the West \"hides a monumental neocolonial transformation of this region [former socialist European countries] into a dependent semi-periphery.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">[3]</ref></s><s>ichardson\\'s criticism acts in the same spirit, looking at the intersection of what these ideological views had produced in the Romanian context of cynicism to activism, national and xenophobic politics and gender and racial inequalities.</s><s>She asks what space and what subjects were produced at these intersections and were expected to be \"integrated.\"</s></p><p><s>The project explores these meanings in three individual moving image works:</s></p><p><s>In Transit , 2 or 3 Things about Activism and Precarious Lives.</s><s>I will focus here on In Transit and Precarious Lives , as they deal with notions of space and identities most clearly.</s><s>I am interested in the formation of precarious spaces and subjects in the context of transition to neoliberalism -as categories useful for critically reviewing recent history via moving images.</s></p><p><s>In Transit (2008) interrogates transition as an ideology and investigates the intertwining nationalist and consumerist co-ordinates of postcommunist Romania, as they appeared in 2007-2008.</s><s>Using archive media, still images from her personal collection, and new footage, Richardson challenges the neo-conservative, anticommunist idea that transition is a forward movement.</s><s>She works with her personal memories and family archive, with the economic conditions of several major cities in Romania, with historical material, interviews with contemporary philosophers, and her own voice (as voiceover but also as her position in relation to the assembled content).</s></p><p><s>A major thread the work follows is the role of Daco-Roman heritage [4] in supporting a communist ideology specific to the Romanian context, its nationalist right-wing views re-emerging in postcommunism, and the process through which this heritage blended with neoliberal consumerism.</s><s>These superimpositions are progressively developed throughout the work with the use of montage.</s><s>The layers are made visible, for example, in images from Cluj, where right-wing mayor Gheorghe Funar had used the city as a canvas to paint in the colors of the Romanian flag.</s></p><p><s>\"All nationalisms are built on myths of origin, but the Romanian one is even more mythical,\" says Richardson in the film\\'s voiceover.</s><s>This myth re-emerges across a considerable duration and in a number of spaces across the city.</s><s>To show its traces, Richardson uses material from an interview with philosopher Gáspár Miklós Tamás, [5]  who argues that Romanian communism was not based on a Marxist-Leninist ideology, but on a theory of Daco-Roman continuity.</s><s>Tamás asserts that calling Romanian communism a form of Soviet totalitarianism is incorrect.</s></p><p><s>In fact, proto-nationalist baggage shaped Romanian communism, and especially Ceaușescu\\'s interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.</s><s>Moreover, Tamás also reminds one of Romania\\'s fascist past, most notably visible in recent history around the Iron Guard and the military dictatorship <ref type=\"bibr\">[6]</ref> of Ion Antonescu, under whose rule Romania had been before communism.</s><s>In 2007-8, these traces and the politics of urban space were being negotiated: nationalist and xenophobic sentiment re-emerged via aesthetic and archaeological means.</s><s>First, by painting urban furniture (Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_0\">1</ref>), making the material layers of aesthetics and politics visible in the streets, and secondly, through the exposure of parts of these histories in situ , in sight of the city\\'s inhabitants (Figure <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_1\">2</ref>).</s><s>Funar\\'s interventions excavated these historical layers and set them together with newly built edifices.</s><s>In Transit explains how in the city of Cluj, Funar ordered Daco-Roman archaeological sites to be opened, and the \"foundational\" ruins to be exposed through glass screens.</s><s>These sites support the right-wing mayor\\'s view whilst inadvertently acting as evidence of the ongoing xenophobia directed at Cluj\\'s Hungarian population, the largest ethnic minority in the country.</s><s>This intention is, as Tamás points out, continuous with Ceaușescu\\'s naming the city Cluj-Napoca in 1974, the closest to its Daco-Roman name.</s></p><p><s>When Funar\\'s mandate ended in 2004, a liberal mayor took turn over Cluj and investments in real estate started pouring in for a short while.</s><s>The largest shopping mall in the country was built here.</s><s>During construction, Roman ruins were found in the foundations.</s><s>The decision was made not to cease building the mall, but to incorporate an archaeological museum within its premises.</s><s>This leads to an interesting superimposition with Romania\\'s nationalist past and how these archaeological traces allowed this past to resurface during transition.</s><s>As the camera pans across various outlets in the mall, Richardson argues this view \"resembles a parallel city -streets named after heroes, an artificial fountain-lake, a stage for cultural events, and even a subterraneous museum.\"</s><s>The archaeological site thus becomes exposed within this faux city, whilst in the actual city of Cluj, the paint chips off the urban furniture and reveals the previously painted colors of the Romanian flag.</s><s>Richardson mirrors the way in which history is played out in the politics of space with the way she constructs the film.</s><s>The act of unearthing these long histories of expropriation, abuse and violence in Romania\\'s historical and political past is matched with the unearthing of her personal histories.</s><s>An account of Richardson\\'s mother and her affiliation with the Romanian Communist Party runs parallel with the city\\'s histories.</s><s>Her mother\\'s disillusionment with the Party proved unconvincing to the Austrian government who apparently wanted stories of violent coercion in exchange for refugee status.</s></p><p><s>Equally, the film\\'s investigation into the histories and possibilities for collective action is mirrored by an excavation into the motivations and positions Richardson herself holds.</s><s>In the feminist tradition of reflecting on how the personal is political, Richardson re-traces these superimpositions and shows how her personal history is tied inextricably to Romania\\'s nationalist communism and its fascist past.</s><s>These pasts meet for a moment in 2007, when she returns, when transition had been declared over, flows of foreign capital entered the country, an archaeological museum lived inside of a mall, and the national flag appeared behind layers of chipped paint on costly but poorly redecorated urban furniture.</s><s>Unsurprisingly, just one year later, in 2008, the consequences of one of the most recent crisis of capitalism started to produce ripples all the way into the credit-infused Romanian economy. <ref type=\"bibr\">[7]</ref></s><s> the backdrop of these crises in a \"post-postcommunist\" Romania, In Transit makes visible all the traces of nationalism, postfascism (in Tamás\\'s sense of the term) and the previous insertions of capital.</s><s>Richardson performs a recursive move to these spaces, to these histories and an excavation -exposing the deep temporalities where one\\'s personal archives cannot but be tied into the histories of post-totalitarian fascism that converse so well with contemporary global capitalism.</s><s>The 1970s New Left movements in some countries from Eastern Europe (the Hungarian Lukacs School or the Yugoslavian Praxis group) had not been possible in the Romanian context because, as Tamás argues in the film \"the national-Bolshevik product was just as much fascist (if not more so) than communist.\"</s><s>In Transit untangles this genealogy and complicates reductive views which imagine 1989 as a break from one state (communism, socialism) and the \"free\" movement into another (neoliberalism, capitalism).</s><s>Most commonly encountered as the neoconservative phrasing of Francis Fukuyama, <ref type=\"bibr\">[8]</ref> where the end of (blanket termed) socialism became \"the end of history,\" from which point there was only one other conceivable stage: capitalism.</s><s>In this linear view, temporality and spatiality were subsumed to the progressive accumulation of \"forward movements.\"</s><s>Where Romania was concerned, the neoconservative Vladimir Tismăneanu wrote that \"looking back and thinking forward\" <ref type=\"bibr\">[9]</ref> needed to become the two types of movements and attitudes to have in postcommunism.</s><s>\"Back\" was the communist space, failed and left behind, whilst \"forward\" was a \"thinkable time\" and a space imaginable and aspirational, of the future.</s><s>He read the prefix \"post\" in postcommunism as if it described a measurable time, which would begin when the transition was over.</s><s>However, looking back never engaged with the running issues of inequality, racism and fascism.</s><s>These are precisely the traces that re-emerge in surprising ways on their own.</s></p><p><s>In Transit engages directly with these omissions pervasive in Romania in the period frequently labeled \"the\" transition.</s><s>Richardson narrates the complex political situation and its entanglement with a recent history that left its traces in urban space.</s><s>The ideas dominating discourse up to when In Transit was made (2007-8) shared a teleological character, where a scientifically foreseeable end point of transition into democracy could be determined.</s><s>These approaches were aligned with technocratic neoliberalism, disregarded specific local, spatial and temporal rhythms of development and foreclosed diversity by offering a \"one size fits all\" model of transition.</s><s>But most importantly, as Boris Buden observed, these ideas suggested that \"the question of the future in postcommunism [wa]s considered as already answered.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">[10]</ref></s><s>Progress, in these anti-Marxist views, was not brought forward by revolution.</s><s>Rather, the events of 1989 were re-conceptualized as \"rebirths,\" [11] which allowed building on presumably empty grounds, as if \"the transition to democracy start[ed] as a radical reconstruction out of nothing.\"</s><s>[12] Understanding the 1989 revolutions as rebirths visualized postcommunist space as a razed ground where building anew was fully legitimated.</s><s>Consequently, this space became \"the landscape after the battle,\" [13] an exit point from communism, a space ready for the next attack, or, in the most positive liberal versions, a space for \"fighting for a public sphere.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">[14]</ref></s><s>However, as was seen with the city excavations and how they were instrumentalized, these grounds were never empty.</s></p><p><s>The aforementioned Vladimir Tismăneanu has played a crucial part in establishing a strong climate of anticommunism in Romania, leading the Presidential Commission for the Analysis of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania , and as one the editors of the Final Report (on communism) of 2006.</s><s>This commission and its Report have been criticized for their problematic connections to governmental and political structures, the arguments proposed, and the premises -especially about truth -which they rest upon.</s><s>[15]   Whilst acknowledging Romania\\'s violent fascist past and the specific configurations of what came to be known as Romanian \"communism,\" a critical position vis-à-vis the conflation of the two is necessary.</s><s>Richardson aims to do this with the montage sequence from Cluj, discussed above.</s><s>With that montage, she wishes to complicate reductive views of both these pasts, and to counter the concept of \"transition\", especially in how it has been linked to ideology and used for political and economic gain of several right-wing and liberal governments, in postcommunism.</s><s>In another reflexive note from In Transit, Richardson states that \"postcommunism is not a new stage of history\" and that a limited view of postcommunism demands \"a categorical rejection of communism, a purely emotional condemnation, without analysis, without reflection.\"</s><s>Key moments in recent Romanian history need to be anchored in a commitment to challenge an imagination of time organized in blocks, which, when internalized, \"takes the place of remembering,\" as Richardson continues to say in the work.</s></p><p><s>In this vein, the revolution of 1989, as a moment in recent history, was part of a longer temporality.</s><s>Equally, it is important to see \"transition\", as Ovidiu Țichindeleanu has argued, <ref type=\"bibr\">[16]</ref> as a concept emerging and changing during communism, alongside its counterpart in postcommunism, where it was often seen as just a stage towards integration into democratic, political and economic European structures of governmentality.</s><s>Thus, a critical approach to postcommunism needs to re-frame how we understand what happened \"after\" the event.</s><s>This is a political task, which urges to revisit the so-called \"condition\" as a lived experience and not as a malaise that needed overcoming.</s><s>Therefore, a critical theory of postcommunism calls for a different understanding of time, space and subjectivity, of what local movements imply and involve.</s><s>In addition, re-assessing postcommunism also means to ask for a re-evaluation of what can stand for documents of the communist period, as well as for the postcommunist one. <ref

union because she needed waged labor and how this has offered her access to organizing skills and the initial excitement around the prospects that unionizing could bring.</s><s>She then reflects on

raise issues around the ageist policies of restructuring, re-training, and re-specialization that women had to go through once factories were privatized or closed.</s><s>Furthermore, after 1989 some

of Transition depicts the dynamic of a relationship between a so-called postcommunist subject, seen most clearly in Precarious Lives , as vulnerable and expected to offer her physical and emotional labor in all of the historical periods and the spaces she traverses and negotiates between.</s><s>The notion of transition became the transactional currency, which offered this subject a closed imagination of what a future can be: a version of the multiple pasts, where oppression and inequality were only folded in and never questioned.</s><s>Moreover, the subject of postcommunist Romania remained relatively unsure when this transition started, but she was informed it had ended around 2007, with Romania\\'s integration into the structures of the European Union. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">[26]</ref></s><s>In Transit mentions how this event was announced and celebrated officially, in the public square of the city of Timișoara.</s><s>From that point, the constructed

subject was no longer in transition, she was told.</s><s>As we see in the interviews in Precarious Lives , she was relatively free to move, to work, and to travel.</s><s>At the same time, the arguable integration was precisely into this unresolved problem, a time-space of violent flows of European modernity, and its more recent fascist pasts.</s><s>Romania, too, has had these histories of violence, and Richardson discussed some of these traces in the work In Transit .</s><s>Violence also partially legitimated political and economic structures throughout the period of transition.</s><s>Racism, dispossession, gender inequality, precarity, and the nationalist recuperations of a Daco-Roman past are not divorced from, but continuous with the communist period and were equally present in postcommunism, as much as they are present in the contemporary. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">[28]</ref></s><s>Joanne Richardson intended to make these connections and continuities visible through the entire Commonplaces of Transition project, as well as to question the specific inequalities and abuses produced in the period of Romanian postcommunism.</s></p><p><s>Neverthess, despite short reflexive moments, Richardson does not address how these concerns on inequality and precarity stand at the intersection of gender and race.</s><s>In Romania\\'s case, Roma women have not only suffered the same conditions of oppression as white Romanian women, but have also been the subjects of a long history of slavery and racism.</s><s>[29] Centering Roma women\\'s experience in accounts of inequality is essential, starting from the history of slavery in Romania and extending to the European Union, the migrant and reproductive labor of Roma women has been extracted, un-or underpaid.</s><s>In Romania, Roma actress and performer Mihaela Drăgan has been popularizing the term \"giuvlipen,\" which is a newly formed word in Romani vocabulary meaning feminism.</s><s>This term is aimed at opening up and making clear, in a similar yet essentially different vein to the work carried by black and brown feminism in the U.S and also across Latin America and South Asia, that a feminist discourse of gender equality in Romania needs to start from race and ethnicity and that Romania needs to engage with its history of slavery and oppression of Roma women.</s><s>In the contemporary, this would imply re-engaging with these long histories of oppression and abuse starting from Roma women\\'s experiences as enslaved subjects, their experiences of state violence during lived communism, and under the prescriptions of the postcommunist condition that followed.</s></p><p><s>The Ceaușescu regime and Romanian communism were legitimated by a reading of Marxism-Leninism through a problematic turn to the Daco-Roman ancestral heritage of Romania, which has resurfaced in recent years as xenophobic and racist myths of origins.</s><s>At times, this revival in nationalist narratives was coupled with anticommunism and the Christian Orthodox religion, validated by its oppression during communism, and state supported.</s><s>This was further complemented by fierce neoliberalism and racism and thus, what has been settling in is a form of generalized cynicism and distrust in political action.</s><s>Departing from Richardson\\'s work, I have explored the possibility of formulating a critical position towards the postcommunist condition and the postcommunist subject as they have been imagined in liberal ideology.</s><s>Accordingly, any contemporary project of critical theory and artistic production should be to critically assess this long history of recuperative narratives, be they around economic, ethnic, or national regeneration.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Author Biography</head></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" xml:id=\"fig_0\"><head>Figure 1

over the ages interest in fashion was variously stigmatized, as by Pliny in classical times, or valorized, as by Marco Polo and the traders along the Silk Road in the Middle Ages.</s><s>Both Pliny and Marco Polo were translated into English in Elizabethan England: Pliny by Philemon Holland in 1601, and Marco Polo\\'s Milione by John Frampton in 1579. 2 The descriptions of exotic wonders, and especially of gems and textiles, fascinated English readers.</s><s>The influence of Italian fashion extended to an appreciation of fabrics and style, embedded in recognized cultural models, as in the luxury and opulence of imperial Rome, and later in Renaissance Italy and Tudor England <ref type=\"bibr\">(Greenblatt)</ref>.</s><s>With the enactment of sumptuary laws prohibiting extravagance, fashion became a forbidden fruit, especially for women, in Italian cities and in England during the late Middle Ages and Renaissance.</s><s>The regulation and proscription of fashion was largely based on class and gender.</s><s>At the time of Shakespeare, fashion discourse was influenced by complex cultural dynamics: on the one hand displays of elegance, style, and manners were held up as models of virtue; on the other, they were seen as signs of frivolity and moral turpitude, as in the case of feminine immodesty.</s></p><p><s>The first English edition of Baldassarre Castiglione\\'s influential treatise on courtly manners and elegance, Il Cortegiano (Venice, 1528), was published in London in 1561, translated by Thomas Hoby as The Book of the Courtier.</s><s>It was followed by Monsignor Della Casa\\'s Galateo <ref type=\"bibr\">(Venice, 1558)</ref>, translated by Robert Peterson as Galateo: The Rules of Polite Behaviours in 1575.</s><s>The Galateo expounds rules of etiquette, including those around dress and table manners, even for the common people <ref type=\"bibr\">(Paulicelli Writing fashion)</ref> Attention to the art of tailoring also is represented in the visual arts by Giovanni Battista Moroni\\'s portrait of Il Tagliapanni (The Tailor or \\'Cloth Cutter\\'), executed between 1565 and 1570.</s><s>The painting portrays an elegantly dressed young man with a light beard.</s><s>He is wearing a cream-coloured doublet or jerkin (Italian \\'farsetto\\'), and voluminous puffed hoses, imitative of the Spanish fashion of the seventeenth century.</s><s>The white ruff collar, or \\'rebato\\', matches the cuffs on his sleeves.</s><s>He displays other signs of distinction, like a hilt and a codpiece, and his intensely focused gaze indicates that tailoring is a very serious activity for men (Fig. <ref type=\"figure\" target=\"#fig_0\">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The earnestness and attention to detail displayed by the tailor in relation to his profession set him apart from the incendiary preachers and their sermons of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, from Jacopone da Todi to Bernardino da Siena, from Gerolamo Savonarola to Agostino Lampugnani (Paulicelli \"Mapping the world\").</s><s>San Bernardino, in particular, in his Prediche volgari <ref type=\"bibr\">(Siena, 1424)</ref>, cursed the length of trains and mantles, which he likens to the tail of the devil <ref type=\"bibr\">(Fabbri)</ref>:</s></p><p><s>O donne, ditemi: che fa la coda de la donna quando ella va per via di state?</s><s>Fa polvere, e di verno s\\'imbratta nel fango, colui che le va dietro di state si ha lo n\\'censo che ella fa, e chiamasi quello lo \\'ncenso del diavolo.</s><s>Or vediamo: di verno infangasi e guastasi il che s\\'involle nel fango come fa una porca (Bernardino da Siena 424-25; emphasis added).</s></p><p><s>Women\\'s clothing was subject to attack for being too long as well as too short.</s><s>One century later, in 1553, the women of Ascoli would rebel against the Anziani e il Consiglio dei Cento as they defended the shortness of their clothing and the showing of their ankles in terms of keeping their clothes from dragging on the ground: Se responne et dicemo: Nui aver assai corretto et ridutto el vestir nostro assai in bono essere che ve dovete recordare nel passato tempo andavano le donne scollate denante et derete, forcia assai dessonesta.</s><s>Del che avemo redutto la portatura nostra multo onorevole, come apertamente se vede, che li nosri juppuni che ne coprino non solo el petto e le spalle ma tutta la gola, che non se vede in nui solo la faccia schietta chietta <ref type=\"bibr\">[…]</ref> Sopra de questo passo che se dirà de li homini nel loro vestire... (qtd. in Levi Pisetzky, Il costume 40). 3   There follows an attack against the recent trends of masculine fashion: \"Nel vestir corto per mostrate un pare de calze vacherate, usate far casache et corpette tanto corte, che mostrare tutte le chiappe et natiche integer de riete, et non solo de riete ma anchora denanti venete a mostrare certe brochette toste\" (41; emphasis added). 4</s><s>  Fashion in Transition: From Italy to Italy</s></p><p><s>The subject of clothing and engraved illustrations peaked at the time of the staging of William Shakespeare\\'s The Taming of the Shrew (ca.</s><s>1590) and The Winter <ref type=\"bibr\">\\'s Tale (ca. 1610)</ref>.</s><s>In France from 1520 to 1610, more than two hundred translated editions on fashion manuals were produced (Masiola \"Moda in traduzione\"; Roche 12-13).</s><s>Fashions and textiles from abroad gave rise to loan words and calques referring to particular items, especially items from France, Italy, and Spain. 5</s><s>The translation of the fashion lexicon evidences a highly permeable area in terms of calques and loan words, with variations and divergences in Shakespearean translations and adaptations (Fishlin and Fortier).</s><s>My choice of the two plays, The Taming of the Shrew and The Winter\\'s Tale, is based on their popularity, their focus on fashion, and their Italian setting. 6</s><s> Both give the illusion that fashionable accessories and precious ornaments were available in Italy, away from the prohibitions of Tudor laws.</s><s>The regulation of clothing under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I was meant to codify social status in clothing, and to curb luxury and excess.</s><s>The Act Against Wearing Costly Apparel, passed by Henry VIII\\'s first parliament (1510), prohibited the use of crimson or blue velvet to anyone below the level of the Order of the Garter.</s><s>The prohibition also applied to the wearing of velvet, satin, and damask in doublets, gowns, and coats.</s><s>Sumptuary laws under Mary Tudor regulated ruffs; Elizabeth was also active in the making of sumptuary laws and proclamations <ref type=\"bibr\">(Hooper)</ref>.</s><s>This resulted in an increase in imports of luxury textiles; there were prohibitions on embroidered silks, \\'tinseled\\' satins, furs, or \\'purpres\\', thus preventing the common people from emulating members of the court. 7</s><s>In Shakespeare\\'s plays set in Italy these laws were apparently flouted, as can be seen in The Merchant of Venice.</s><s>Transgression has been a recurrent theme in the history of costume. 8</s><s>The Taming of the Shrew features several references to fashion items and accessories, emphasizing the aspiration to luxury and elegance in female fashions through the presence of a tailor and a haberdasher.</s><s>As in other plays of its time, there is a correlation with Italian sources, in particular with Lodovico Ariosto\\'s Suppositi (1508), translated by George Gascoignes as The Supposes and staged even before its printing. 9</s><s>As in other Shakespearean works, issues arise when translating plays that are set in Italy, as they feature a lexicon of fashion and food which is specific to Elizabethan England (Masiola Il fascino 47-52).</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>The Allure of Italian Fashion: Translation and Exoticism</head><p><s>In Shakespeare\\'s plays fashion and vanity are often presented as a subtext, and the relevant terminology is used in different ways depending on the context and is represented with consistent variations; this lexical asymmetry can be seen in the diachronic corpus of Italian translations fashion terms. 10</s><s>In The Taming of the Shrew, there is an old rich suitor trying to win the favour of Bianca, Katherina Minola\\'s sister.</s><s>The action is set in Padua:</s></p><p><s>(1) Gremio: My hanging all of Tyrian tapestry.</s><s>In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns, In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework <ref type=\"bibr\">(2.1.353-58)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The description emphasizes not only provenance but also style;

Aulò! (Rome, <ref type=\"bibr\">Kimerafilm, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The memory and awareness of a long colonial past are central to postcolonial European identity-and Italy is no exception to this rule.</s><s>Yet contemporary Italy seems to have forgotten its own colonial history in Africa that ended abruptly with military defeat in the early 1940s and (in the national perception) was swept away together with the massive and encumbering presence of fascism.</s><s>The lingering persistence of such past and, at the same time, the lack of an adequate knowledge and revision of the Italian role in colonialism is one of the issues engendering an uneasy and problematic present in republican, post fascist Italy.</s><s>And this is precisely the issue addressed by Simone Brioni in two interesting multimedia publications, Somalitalia and Aulò!</s><s>Aulò! Aulò! <ref type=\"bibr\">(Rome, Kimerafilm, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The two booklets are in fact precious caskets where useful commentaries and historical assessments frame and introduce two excellent documentaries on DVD-the autobiographies of two postcolonial subjects, Kaha and Ribka.</s><s>The two women are Italian citizens who were born and raised in former Italian colonies-Kaha Mohamed Aden in Somalia and Ribka Sibhatu in Eritrea-and then migrated to Italy as political refugees.</s><s>They live, respectively, in Pavia (northern Italy) and Rome (the capital, heavily imprinted with colonial marks)two towns that act as backdrops to their oral narratives of home and exile, uprooting, dislocation and relocation.</s><s>Their voices often break into song and poetry, or linger on nostalgia and even sorrow.</s><s>The documentaries are the result of teamwork by Simone Brioni, Graziano Chiscuzzu and Ermanno Guida.</s><s>In Kaha\\'s autobiography, \\'The Fourth Road to Mogadishu\\', the view of ancient Pavia crossed by the peaceful Ticino river alternates with images of Mogadishu, the city of love and childhood, described as a multi-layered structure including four main roads stretching along the Indian Ocean and its white beaches.</s><s>The far removed past of the white and elegant Islamic city (first road) stands in Kaha\\'s mnestic eye next to the colonial town (second road) and the new socialist Mogadishu born out of independence (third road)-while the fourth road is a dark path full of ruins and danger, created by the warlords who still rule and threaten the country.</s><s>Mogadishu, like Pavia, has many pasts and many histories-and so does Kaha, who feels both Italian and Somali and enjoys the beauty of both her languages of the heart in writing fiction in Italian.</s></p><p><s>Ribka\\'s narration, \\'Poems of Nostalgia, Exile and Love\\', is a powerful assertion of identity, for while remembering her native Eritrea and longing for it, she insists she wants to be considered \\'a true Roman\\'.</s></p><p><s>Here the background sights of imperial Rome are offered along with the traces of colonial events inscribed on the streets and squares of the modern capital erected on the banks of the \\'blond Tiber\\', while Ribka comments with her \\'aulò\\'-a classical style of poetry from the Horn of Africa-and warns that some of those celebrated as heroes were in fact invaders and colonizers.</s><s>The names of far away places that have entered Italian language and assumed local idiomatic connotations-such as \\'Ambaradam\\' or \\'AmbaAlagi\\'-are repositioned into their original, geographic meanings.</s><s>Her multiple memory and identity engender a deeper insight into reality, and unmask the lies of an unredeemed history.</s></p><p><s>Both Kaha and Ribka smile and sing when they remember their homes, and often mention the aromas and perfumes of Puntland, as that part of Africa was called.</s><s>Listeners are suavely persuaded of the pervasive presence of a smell of coffee and incense.</s><s>The act of writing fiction (Kaha) or poetry (Ribka) has a relevant role in their individual lives, for it allows them to blend their multiple identities into one personality and at the same time state their hold on the ground they are now standing on.</s><s>It is an Italian soil marked by a multiplicity of histories not all of which are subsumed in the cultural consciousness of the nation.</s><s>For these reasons, and for the beauty of their presence, their postcolonial voices spinning an ironic tale reminiscent of unforgettable empires come as a blessing for contemporary Italy.</s></p><p><s>From 1990 onwards, there has been a harvest of writings in Italian coming from immigrants of African origin and ushered in by autobiographical texts initially written with the help and support of Italian authors.</s><s>(From this viewpoint, Simone Brioni\\'s publications still belong to this early stream of cultural expressions).</s><s>The condition of the African-Italian immigrants (such as Kaha and Ribka) is remarkably different from postcolonial African writers in English, French or Portuguese, that is, in languages they had practised even before emigrating to Europe or elsewhere in the West, for European imperial presence usually imposed its own language and literary traditions on its colonial subjects and helped preserve them after the end (or fall) of empires.</s><s>Italy\\'s colonial history was too brief and its national identity still too shaky for such patterns to be adopted.</s><s>Moreover, since the end of the Italian colonial empire coincided with a lost world war and a general upheaval of postfascism, no attention nor energy were devoted to keeping up an Italian cultural presence in former colonies.</s><s>Somalia, Eritrea and Libya-and of course most of all Ethiopia-are evident examples of this.</s><s>Thus, African migrants who started to arrive in Italy in the 1980s only seldom had background knowledge of the Italian language, and certainly no knowledge of Italian literature.</s><s>They learned the new language orally, and were never shaped or influenced by the long and important Italian literary tradition.</s></p><p><s>Kaha and Ribka pour their fluent Italian into their own previously African mould, and what comes out of it is a highly hybrid, African-Italian, result.</s><s>Ribka\\'s \\'aulò\\' and Kaha\\'s short stories are examples of this situation and draw a landscape that is unique in postcolonial Europe.</s></p><p><s>One of the side-effects of this phenomenon is, that the written production of these new writers of African origin was not considered as literary and therefore basically ignored by Italian literary criticism.</s><s>Attention and analysis have rather come from the field of cultural and postcolonial studies, where the debate on the canon has managed to reduce diffidence and prejudice.</s><s>Again, Brioni\\'s works confirm that a culturalist approach is particularly fruitful and is also likely to contribute positively to a general political and historical re-reading of Italian colonial history.</s></p><p><s>In the introductory section of the documentary on Ribka Sibathu, Brioni interviews at random a number of ordinary Italians basking in the sun on a beach near Rome, none of whom seems to know even where Eritrea is positioned geographically-striking evidence of the fact that Eritrea does not enter the memory and awareness of contemporary Italians.</s><s>The national forgetfulness of colonial history characterizes many, if not all, aspects of the Italian scenery.</s><s>Let us take museums-institutions that are so relevant in the Italian cultural landscape.</s><s>There are no traces of Italian colonial history in Italian museums, even when they exhibit African artifacts.</s><s>And many important materials coming from the colonial presence in

something that passes of its own accord; or something that occurs not in or as a moment, but in and as duration -not an event, but a state of affairs.</s><s>Thinking of crisis in these terms produces echoes that resonate with Bachmann and that feature in other ways in McMurtry\\'s narrative: Benjamin\\'s account of modernity as a crisis of the idea of crisis itself -an undoing of the idea that one might get beyond crisis;<ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_2\">foot_2</ref> Hofmannsthal\\'s Sprachkrise as a retrospective performance and undermining of a description of the collapse of representation; and finally, Bachmann\\'s Ein Ort für Zufälle [A Place for Coincidences] (so well analysed here) as an exemplary text of temporality itself in crisis.</s><s>McMurtry\\'s account is trying to manage two competing impulses in its own argument: one that posits a continuity in the development of Bachmann\\'s aesthetic, and one that is built around the idea of suddenness and its \\'urgent\\' demands.</s><s>It is, says McMurtry, \\'the urgent voicing of present-tense distress\\' that lends the late prose work its \\'impact and radicality\\' (Crisis, p. 17); and it is the purpose of her book to link this private experience with the later, more reflective and refracted notion of \\'die Krankheit unserer Zeit\\' [the sickness of our time] (Crisis, p. 18).</s></p><p><s>A simultaneous strength and weakness of the book is the weight of Bachmann criticism that is brought to bear on the fragile material of the two late poetry volumes.</s><s>McMurtry\\'s management of her field is deeply impressive; but the poems themselves struggle to sustain the force of critical speak that is heaped upon them.</s><s>This is most obvious in the close readings, where there is little to do other than repeat, lightly glossed, the painful, personal content (\\'Meine Schreie verliere ich\\' [I am losing my screams] or \\'Abschied\\' [Leave-taking]) <ref type=\"bibr\">(Crisis,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">pp. 39,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">46)</ref>, and where the gap between the suffering and the aesthetic theory seems widest.</s><s>But McMurtry\\'s critical scaffolding is certainly formidable.</s><s>Chapter One on Bachmann\\'s writing in the 1960s follows Christine Kanz and Ingeborg Dusar in its explication of the importance of Georg Groddeck\\'s Das Buch vom Es <ref type=\"bibr\">[The Book of the It, 1923]</ref>. 7</s><s>Groddeck\\'s understanding of illness, which casts physical symptoms as performers of unsayable truths, appeals to Bachmann\\'s sense that the body speaks; it speaks creatively, representatively -that is to say, on behalf of the community -but often against the rational, censored language of that community.</s><s>For McMurtry, this \\'other\\' language of the sick body feeds the broader argument that Bachmann\\'s poetic depiction of alcoholism and breakdown is a conscious attempt to forge an aesthetic capable of bringing to language the taboos of social and aesthetic convention.</s><s>Another intertext in this project (according to Bachmann herself) is Sylvia Plath\\'s The Bell Jar <ref type=\"bibr\">(1963)</ref>, which exemplifies the struggle to translate personal, lived experience into the stuff of art and the stuff of society (Plath: \\'start with self and extend outwards\\', Crisis, p. 52).</s><s>McMurtry also draws parallels between Plath\\'s and Bachmann\\'s respective moves from poetry to prose, suggesting that, in each case, it was linked to the increasing, and increasingly political, centrality of lived experience for the writers, and their concomitant efforts to find form for that experience.</s></p><p><s>McMurtry then moves on to Dialektik der Aufklärung [Dialectic of Enlightenment] and \\'the repression of the physical realm within rational Western culture\\' (Crisis, p. 61), a line of interpretation applied previously to Bach mann by Sigrid Weigel, Marion Schmaus and Georgina Paul. 8</s><s>McMurtry\\'s contribution is to integrate the poetic drafts into this framework: \\'In the draft entitled \"Gerüche\" [Smells], Bachmann could be read as experimenting, under the influence of having read Dialektik der Aufklärung, with her own status as a woman who figures nature within culture\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Crisis,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">p. 61)</ref>.</s><s>Adorno is also invoked as a precursor to Bachmann\\'s familiar insistence that fascism lives on postfascism.</s><s>And so, all the ingredients are in place: the politicization (that is to say, generalization) of individual experience, mind-body dualism, male-female dualism, poetry-prose dualism and the afterlife of fascist modes of behaviour.</s><s>If this all seems like too much to bear for the poetic fragments, the proliferation 7 Ingeborg Dusar, Choreographien der Differenz.</s><s>Ingeborg Bachmanns Prosaband \\'Simultan\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Cologne, 1994)</ref>;

once conveying a sense of the overwrought, they are now deployed in service of the \\'wrought narrative\\' of \\'a self-consciously dramatized form\\' (Crisis, p. 172).</s><s>For McMurtry, this transformation is part of a greater shift to formal abstraction and more generalized, less subjective claims about society and its discontents.</s></p><p><s>The final chapter works similarly in terms of methodology and argument.</s><s>This time the intertextual line that is traced (via Adorno, Nietzsche and Corinna Caduff) from the late poetry to Malina is Wagner\\'s Tristan and Isolde.</s><s>The analysis rests on now familiar ground, aiming \\'to illuminate an early stage of a textuality that arises out of personal crisis but develops into a metonymic mode to enable oblique expression of social and cultural critique\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Crisis,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">p. 192)</ref>.</s><s>Less obliquely put: \\'Through radical formal innovation, Bachmann\\'s prose succeeds in developing a viable aesthetic mode for the expression of crisis where, arguably, the majority of her late poetic drafts do not\\' (Crisis, p. 217).</s><s>This core thesis is argued consistently and strongly by McMurtry.</s><s>She is convincing in her reading of the late poetry as directly caused by personal pain, and directly flying in the face of contemporary poetic form, and social and political acceptability.</s><s>She is also convincing in her reading of the late prose as being formally and ideologically defined by indirectness; despite all the intertextual reference, pointing readers to putative sources, Malina disrupts causality while at the same time drawing attention to what McMurtry terms (with strong echoes of Weigel), its \\'processes of concealment\\' (Crisis, p. 225).</s><s>Many Bachmann readers, feeding on a mixture of instinct and knowledge, will agree with both aspects of this argument.</s><s>If there is a limit to this achievement, it is probably that they might have assumed her claims to be uncontroversial (in any strong sense) at the outset.</s><s>What stands, however, is the writer\\'s great store of Bachmann knowledge, and the service she has done for those who follow her, not perhaps in casting new light or showing new paths, but certainly in illuminating what underpins where we (diversely) are.</s><s>* * * * * Katya Krylova\\'s paths, on the other hand, are decidedly literal, rather than metaphorical in nature.</s><s>Walking through History.</s><s>Topography and Identity in the Works of Ingeborg Bachmann and Thomas Bernhard walks the reader through the territory that houses the action (or inaction) of the writers\\' respective plots, and reads that territory using various sets of interpretative tools.</s><s>Here, history is Ge(h)-schichte [walking through layers]; but as my last sentence demonstrates, even with the best will in the world, there is no escaping metaphor.</s><s>Walking, housing, plots, territories, tools all seem to breed excessive meaning and the metaphorical ground beneath literal feet shifts threateningly.</s><s>The reason for this is the nature of signification itself: words\\' suspension above the reality they signify, their failure to designate and contain, their failure to \\'ground\\' reality, communication, identity.</s><s>The problem of these failures, as well She returns to these terms repeatedly throughout the course of her book, attending carefully to their interpretative richness.</s><s>Krylova\\'s purpose in this is to establish the legitimacy of her concern with topography and, with that, her book\\'s overall claim: namely, that the way in which the environment is inscribed in Bachmann\\'s and Bernhard\\'s works mirrors the psychic states of their characters, who themselves mirror the authors\\' concern with the collective state of postwar Austria.</s><s>When we read the ground, therefore, we read the individual and we read the country.</s><s>And when we speak of the ground, we speak not just of physical things (earth, landscape, cityscape, architecture), but also of the metaphysical (origins, reason, language itself) and, finally, with Bachmann, Heidegger and Leibniz, of the ungroundedness, or multi-groundedness, of ground itself.</s></p><p><s>Notwithstanding the potential dizziness of these incessant moves between the material and philosophical aspects of topography, Krylova\\'s theoretical grounds are clearly laid out in her introduction.</s><s>Her analysis is engendered by and contributes to what is called \\'the topographical turn\\' (Topography, p. 18), a set of critical methodologies associated with thinkers such as Pierre Nora, Aleida Assmann and J. Hillis Miller.</s><s>Her main sources, however, are those of a previous generation, namely, Walter Benjamin and Sigmund Freud.</s><s>For Krylova, Freud\\'s Unbehagen in der Kultur [Civilization and its Discontents] provides her original metaphor -the psyche is structured like a city -while Benjamin\\'s Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels [The Origin of German Tragic Drama] \\'conceives history as topographically inscribed in the natural landscape\\' (Topography, p. 21).</s><s>Events, then, are written into and retained within the landscape, but also written into and retained within the psyche; to walk the landscape is, therefore, to explore the psyche; and the landscape, as well as the mind, can be a site of traumatic inscription -a Symptomkörper [body of symptoms] in search of the talking cure of a walking tour.</s><s>Krylova, in pointing to all of this, is that curative walker, reconnecting displaced symptoms with their traumatic origins.</s><s>And her analysis goes further: the landscape is not a passive receptacle of traumatic affects, nor is it a mere mirror of individual and collective trauma; for Krylova, it is \\'pathologizing and pathogenic\\' (Topography, p. 22), infecting those who inhabit it.</s><s>For this reason, as she later argues, protagonists elicit a complex range of what are termed \\'psychotopographic\\' responses to their environments (Topography, p. 20).</s><s>It is the aim of the book to unfurl and ground those responses.</s><s>One of the ways in which Krylova pursues this project (which hovers, as we have seen, between grounding and ungrounding), is by using Benjamin\\'s description of \\'origin\\' as signifying a process rather than a finite location.</s><s>For Krylova, following Benjamin, Bachmann\\'s and Bernhard\\'s protagonists\\' exploration of their origins will fail to uncover any discrete beginning or endpoint, since: the search for origin unleashes the dynamic of trying to uncover \\'das Ursprüngliche\\' [the original] within the complex process of origination, something that can never be revealed \\'im nackten offenkundigen Bestand des Faktischen\\' [in the naked and overt existence of the factual] but can only be subject to processes of restoration and reestablishment that for this reason will forever remain incomplete.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Topography,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">p. 26)</ref> From this unstable point of departure, Krylova is able to approach the related questions of individual and national identity.</s></p><p><s>The book is structured in a clever and reader-friendly way.</s><s>Between the introduction and conclusion are six chapters featuring three pairs of texts, coupled together for purpose of comparison.</s><s>Chapters One and Two analyse Bachmann\\'s Drei Wege zum See [Three Paths to the Lake] and Bernhard\\'s Ungenach, exploring the search for origins and the relationship to Heimat and, related to this, the Habsburgischer Mythos [Habsburg myth], Joseph Roth and Jean Améry.</s><s>Nationhood is linked here to melancholy (via Freud and Svetlana Boym) and fantasy (interestingly, if briefly, via Žižek\\'s Plague of Fantasies).</s><s>Chapters Three and Four deal with Bachmann\\'s Das Buch Franza [The Book of Franza] and Bernhard\\'s Frost, texts that are \\'concerned with various forms of topographic subjection and the workings of Entstellung [disfigurement] and Verschiebung [displacement] with relation to psychotopography and embodied memory\\' (Topography, p. 33).</s><s>In both texts, says Krylova, \\'emblematic\\' train journeys \\'incubate and allegorize traumatic events\\' (Topography, p. 113):</s></p><p><s>The particular symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder arising in train accident victims in the nineteenth century became known as \\'railway spine\\', an emblem that is foregrounded in Frost in the architectural topography of the train carriage floor with its \\'Blutspur\\' [trail of blood] symbolic of an architecture imbued with traumatic legacy, as well as anticipating, in emblematic fashion, the animal rustling episode of the twenty-fifth day [...].</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Topography,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">p. 115)</ref> Apart from attending to various characteristics of traumatic expression here, Krylova also brings Eric Santner\\'s (and others\\') theorization of \\'the creaturely\\' to bear on Frost, where, she argues: Chapters Five and Six focus on Bachmann\\'s Malina and Bernhard\\'s Auslöschung <ref type=\"bibr\">[Extinction]</ref>.</s><s>The Malina chapter (in my view, the strongest in the book) looks at the significance of Vienna itself, as a city where one must \\'suffer the past\\'.</s><s>Defining this \\'pathogenic cityscape\\' (Topography, p. 140), in Krylova\\'s account, are traumatic markers of collective post-war history, personally invested zones of individual destruction and survival, and infusing these, the ubiquitous, haunting presence of the Habsburg Empire.</s><s>The essence of these mutually dependent spaces -their \\'unterirdische Querverbindungen\\' [underground connections] -is accessed, here, as in Bernhard, through a \\'psychotopographic downward directionality\\' (Topography, p. 153), that is to say, by attending to what lies -revealed and revealingly -beneath.</s><s>Krylova\\'s reading of Auslöschung also centres on the metaphor of a downward or backward journey, in which the workings of the past in the present are uncovered.</s><s>She draws parallels between the dream sequences of the two novels, returns also to the motif of the train journey and to the Kafka influence, before coming to the depiction of Bachmann herself within Bernhard\\'s novel, and the meaning of the now heavily significant title Auslöschung.</s><s>To conceive of writing as simultaneous destruction and preservation brings us back to Malina, or Fanny Goldmann, or to Freud and his Wunderblock.</s><s>\\'Österreich -das ist etwas, das immer weitergeht für mich\\' [For me, Austria is something that continues, on and on] (Topography, p. 249), says Bachmann, says Krylova, before extending her \\'peripatetic working through of topography\\' (Topography, p. 250) to present-day Austria, including in her framework the burial of Otto von Habsburg and Vienna\\'s contemporary Holocaust memorials.</s><s>Krylova\\'s walk through history is, logically, ongoing; the uncovering and re-covering of the past in the present, a process that \\'immer weitergeht\\' [continues, on and on].</s></p><p><s>Notwithstanding the interesting theoretical as well as literary historical space that Krylova maps out in Walking though History, there are two aspects of the book that give this reader pause for thought.</s><s>The first is straightforward: it is the absence of Joachim Hoell\\'s monograph Mythenreiche Vorstellungswelt The volume includes seventeen essays, organized into four sections and preceded by a helpful, informative introduction.</s><s>The first section, according to Solibakke, seeks to ground Bachmann\\'s repeated assertion that violence endures beyond the confines of war, by systematically contextualizing the theme of violence in her work.</s><s>It begins with one of the outstanding essays of the book, Gisela Brinker-Gabler\\'s \\' \"Weiterdenken\": Bachmann, the Public Intellectual\\', which explores Bachmann\\'s understanding of \\'the ties between literary and public responsibility\\'. <ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_7\">15</ref></s><s>Her most important source in this is the essay \\'Politik und Physis\\' [Politics and Physis] (also explored by Áine McMurtry), recently made widely available by its publication in the Kritische Schriften <ref type=\"bibr\">[Critical Writings] volume (2005)</ref>.</s><s>In \\'Politik und Physis\\', Bachmann characterizes her understanding of politics as organic process rather than singular decision, and as embodied rather than disembodied: \\'ein im [Prozess] befindliches Körperwerk dessen Tentakel die anderen [Tentakel] des gesellschaftlichen [Körpers] dauernd berührt, von ihnen abgestoßen und angezogen wird\\' [an embodied entity in process, whose tentacles constantly come into contact with the other tentacles of the social body, being repulsed and attracted by them] (Weapons, p. 23).</s><s>Brinker-Gabler greatly develops our understanding of what is implied in this metaphor, by tracing the Aristotelean roots of \\'physis\\' as \\'phusis\\' (meaning nature), and its particular inflection in Heidegger to describe the \\'self-forming prevailing of beings as a whole\\' (Weapons, p. 23).</s><s>Furthermore, it is argued, this \\'phusis\\' is intimately connected to Heidegger\\'s version of \\'logos\\', which defines a speaking of, and out of, the \\'phusis\\', that is to say, a speaking that shows the \\'phusis\\'.</s><s>For Brinker-Gabler, the interaction and mutual constitution of \\'logos\\' and \\'phusis\\', so defined, are at the heart of Bachmann\\'s literary-political project: \\'She speaks consciously and decisively as \"Einzelne,\" that is, in the singular, as someone who no longer maintains a \"we\" relationship to the public, but whose relation to the \"social as a whole\" and whose engagement with it is processual in character\\' <ref type=\"bibr\">(Weapons,</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">p. 24)</ref>.</s><s>This engagement defines Bachmann as a public intellectual, argues Brinker-Gabler, whose essay, aside from the merit of its main argument, is full of fascinating supporting references -to Blanchot, for example, and to Rosi Braidotti\\'s \\'nomadic subjects\\' (Weapons, p. 27).</s><s>Both of these names are deployed in describing Bachmann\\'s \\'transnationality\\' as a writer.</s><s>For Brinker-Gabler, the transnational impetus describes a kind of will to truth that is continuously in process, that invokes multiple languages and territories, and that happens in the interaction between the singular and the collective, between the centre and the periphery, between literary creativity and political responsibility.</s></p><p><s>The transnational is also the topic of Sara Lennox\\'s contribution, which she describes as an extension of, and counterpart to, the history of Bachmann readings as constructed in her 2006 monograph. <ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_8\">16</ref></s><s>Her essay here counteracts the national bias of that book with a description of the ways in which Bachmann might be read as constitutively concerned with the transnational -for example, in her treatment of the Habsburg legacy.</s><s>This might prompt the question as to whether there is a specificity to the term transnational that will drive genuinely new insights into Bachmann.</s><s>Lennox\\'s own question: \\'What is the point of Bachmann\\'s attention to the transnational?\\' (Weapons, p. 54) and her answer: \\'an emphatic assertion that an entire complex of social circumstances, now conceived to be global, are to blame for the personal unhappiness from which her characters suffer\\' (Weapons, p. 55) tantalizingly side-step the issue.</s></p><p><s>The second section of the volume, \\'Bachmann und das Judentum\\' features three essays on the Celan relationship, one centring on Jack Hamesh and one on testimony.</s><s>Each of these essays, albeit in very different ways, translates the biographical into aesthetic influence.</s><s>Mark Anderson\\'s essay, \\'A Delicate Affair: The Young Ingeborg Bachmann\\', delicately explores Bachmann\\'s early turn from the inward-looking political and aesthetic models of her 1930s youth to the more recognizable values of the mature writer and thinker.</s><s>In this, he argues for the pivotal influence of her personal relationships with Jack Hamesh, Hans Weigel and Paul Celan, and while casting no aspersions on Bachmann\\'s political or aesthetic integrity, does push for a more critical evaluation of her \\'disappointing\\' rewriting of her own past, both in her fictionalized biographical accounts and her biographically infused fictions.</s><s>Given the recent focus on the biographical generally in Bachmann criticism (prompted by the release of materials from the writer\\'s estate and reflected in volumes such as McMurtry\\'s and the 2011 edited collection Mythos Bachmann.</s><s>Zwischen Inszenierung und Selbstinszenierung [The Bachmann Myth.</s><s>Between Performance and Self-Performance]), <ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_9\">17</ref> Anderson\\'s timely essay significantly complicates our understanding of McMurtry\\'s \\'processes of concealment\\', not to mention Bachmann\\'s own \\'Briefgeheimnis\\' [secret of the post], its (paradoxical) exposition by Sigrid Weigel and, finally, the remaining, perhaps sublated secrets of the sealed estate.</s></p><p><s>The highlight of the third section of the book flies by these biographical nets, and will greatly please those readers whose preference is for the creatively philosophical approach to Bachmann.</s><s>Sabine Gölz\\'s \\' \"Böhmen liegt am Meer\": Die Heimkehr in den Grund\\' [\\'Bohemia lies by the sea\\': Returning to base] returns to the most important poetic site of Krylova\\'s favoured topo graphical metaphor -and proceeds to pull the metaphorical carpet from beneath the feet of her fellow critics.</s><s>\\'Grounding\\' our criticism in the stable earth of deconstruction, deterritorialization, openness and so on, may, Gölz argues, ironically repeat the foreclosing interpretative gestures of other, more positivistically inclined methodologies, producing from the mutually satisfying interplay of literature and criticism simply another version of \\'knowledge, nicely browned\\' (Weapons, p. 140).</s><s>In place of such solid outcomes, Gölz proposes a renewed attention to the destabilizing condition of language itself, as a prerequisite to understanding Bachmann\\'s Böhmen [Bohemia, as concept], and her aesthetic practice more generally.</s><s>Bachmann\\'s texts, argues Gölz, \\'haben ein neues Gesetz im Blick.</s><s>Sie sind auf ein neues Rechtsverhältnis zur Sprache hin geschrieben\\' [have a new law in their sights.</s><s>They are written towards a new legal relationship to language] (Weapons, p. 138).</s><s>A new practice -\\'eine neue Leseweise\\' [a new way of reading] (Weapons, p. 138) -would resist the impetus to assimilate all otherness to the existing solid ground of \\'die Disziplin des Bestehenden\\' [the discipline of what already exists]; rather, it would, with Bachmann, performatively \\'return\\' Böhmen to the fluidity of its own nomadic condition.</s><s>It might, of course, be countered that this methodology, too, is a methodology; that the claim to repeat Bachmann\\'s own writerly gesture in this readerly approach to her texts is itself a repetition of the authoritative claims of those Gölz criticizes.</s><s>One might further move to depose the putative sources of Gölz\\'s approach, pointing to the fact that Nomadic Studies, too, defines territory; that language, too, above all in its fictions and metaphors, imperially consumes the material, the experiential, the physical domains.</s><s>The Bachmann of Gantenbein and Franza knows this.</s><s>The Bachmann who never published poems in which the biographical had not yet been consumed and sublated, knows this.</s><s>Notwithstanding its contentiousness (not to say, instability) in the face of so much critical Landvermessung [land surveying], Gölz\\'s utopian plea for a different kind of Bachmann criticism is, literally, vital.</s><s>It also brings a new, ironic dimension to the \\'topographical turn\\' we encountered with Krylova.</s><s>What, we wonder, if the topographical turn, the transnational turn, the biographical turn were themselves to be turned in service of something like this: was wäre, wenn wir in unseren Lektüren den Akzent auf die performative Dimension, die wirkliche Deterritorialisierung und praktizierte Dekonstruktion verschöben?</s><s>Wenn wir dem Gedicht nicht mehr ohne Konsequenzen \\'zustimmten\\', sondern uns dann sogleich fragten, welche Veränderungen in unseren Lesegewohnheiten eine solche Zustimmung impliziert?</s><s>Zu welchen Verschiebungen in unserer literarischen Geographie Finally, then, we come to the fourth section of the book -\\'Interpretationen\\' -and Solibakke\\'s own fine essay \\' \"Fest steht der Schrei\": Zur Krise der Wahrheit in Ingeborg Bachmann\\'s Ein Wildermuth\\' [What stands is the scream: On the crisis of truth in Ingeborg Bachmann\\'s A Wildermuth].</s><s>Exploring the expression of crisis brings us back to where we began, but Solibakke\\'s approach is very different from McMurtry\\'s.</s><s>Here, the crisis is not biographical, but rather \\'eine Krise der Rechtspraxis, die sich zur allumfassenden Krise der Gesellschaft nach 1945 ausweitet\\' [a crisis of legal practice which is expanding into an all-encompassing crisis of post-1945 society] (Weapons, p. 225), and the form in which this crisis finds expression is the judge\\'s scream.</s><s>As such, the essay is essentially about the sayability of Bachmann\\'s truth, a dilemma enacted in the incommensurability of past and present.</s><s>For Solibakke, sayability, the expression of truth, not only leads to the tradition of Chandos and Sprachkrise, but also to Wittgenstein and Heidegger, to Adorno, noise and atonality, and finally, with Cornelia Vismann,<ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_10\">foot_10</ref> to the grounding of the subject in the human voice within the legal domain:</s></p><p><s>Diese stimmhaften Prinzipien beruhen letztlich auf dem Wahrheitsanspruch jener Sprechakte, deren Handlungskompetenz im Rechtsmilieu Ordnungssinn stiftet.</s><s>Kontrastiv markiert ihr Nichtgelingen in der Wildermuth-Erzählung den Riss zwischen der Aussage als Sprechakt und der Aussage als Wahrheitsmoment, als Aufschrei gegen eine verlogene Gesellschaft.</s></p><p><s>[These voiced principles rest ultimately on the truth-claims of those speech acts whose agency founds order in the legal realm.</s><s>In contrast, their failure in the Wildermuth story marks the rupture between the testimony as speech act and testimony as moment of truth, as outcry against an untruthful society.]</s><s>(Weapons, p. 240) * * * * * Taken together, these three Wege zu Bachmann [paths to Bachmann] allow us to make some provisional observations about the current research interests of her academic readers.</s><s>The dominant strands identified here in the commonalities between the monographs and the essay collection are: the biographical and its relation to the aesthetic and the political; and the topographical and its relation to a broadly defined transnationalism.</s><s>As part of this strand -and it remains to be seen if the term itself will yield anything new in terms of insights -the frequency of references to \\'Böhmen liegt am Meer\\' stands out.</s><s>On the one hand, this reflects an increasing concern with the philosophical foundations of Bachmann\\'s sources and her dialectical understanding of truth-telling in literature and philosophy.</s><s>On the other hand, it can be used, as shown in particular by Sabine Gölz, to launch a critical practice that is not always already proposed within existing interpretative (and institutional) parameters.</s><s>This lurch to newness -an imitation of Bachmann\\'s own genre-crossing and utopian impetus -excites in the manner she herself described as arising from acts of reading: \\'Es gibt für mich keine Zitate, sondern die wenigen Stellen in der Literatur, die mich immer aufgeregt haben, die sind für mich das Leben [...], weil sie mich wirklich erregt haben.</s><s>Eben wie Leben\\' [For me, there are no quotations, only the few places in literature which have always excited me; for me, they are life because they have really excited me.</s><s>Like life itself]. <ref type=\"foot\" target=\"#foot_11\">19</ref></s><s>Which is not to say that those readers of Bachmann who gather, assemble, repeat, organize, store and conduct inventories do not have a critical, foundational, not to say grounding role to play in Bachmann studies -they evidentially do.</s><s>But as we look to the further release of materials from the estate, and the prospect of an official biography, it is crucial that a balance be kept between those acts</s></p></div><figure

Must Fall\" campaign began early 2015 at the University of Cape Town, followed by other initiatives such as \"Open up Stellenbosch\" and \"Transform WITS.\"</s><s>The idea of decolonizing universities became the prompt for the formation of a national \"fees must fall\" movement which enjoyed wide popularity on the one and faced increasingly severe state repression on the other hand.</s><s>Some of the measures called for in the campaign to decolonize South African universities were the hiring of black academics, an end to outsourcing of workers, change in curricula, language policies, politics around student residences, the relationships between professors and students, socioeconomic injustices, new forms of political organizing and self-expression, the renaming of buildings, and the removal of statues. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">1</ref> I will discuss these developments in the context of contemporary theories of remembrance, repression and denial and I will relate the debates around decolonization to post-apartheid South African memory politics with a special focus their impact on \"talking race.\"</s><s>A point of reference in making these connections will be the so-called cultural revolution in post-national socialism Germany as it was unfolding in the late 1960s.</s><s>Memory politics surrounding remembrance and denial of the Nazi era are still contested in Germany today, seventy years later.</s><s>As in South Africa, today, it was also about two decades post-conflict that the 1968 student protest movement in West Germany forcefully broke the silence surrounding fascist continuities within the now democratic institutions (and society) of the Federal Republic of Germany.</s><s>Today, about twenty years post apartheid, predominantly black students challenge apartheid legacies and/or white colonial culture, contending that campuses are still dominated by a racist symbolic and economic order.</s><s>They argue that \"as we learn we need to unlearn and develop new epistemologies.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">2</ref></s><s>Students argue that decolonization is not the same as deracialization in the way government seems to understand it: a simply bringing in more black personal.</s><s>Students argue, might simply reproduce the old order.</s><s>They oppose processes of assimilation, co-option or integration (black people being \\'welcomed\\' into institutions)-their aim is rather to radically change the whole system.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>A Speaking Race under Conditions of Coloniality</head><p><s>The debates on the anti-, the non-, the post-, the neo-of racialization and racism have been unfolding with enormous velocity since 2015 and the ability to shift the discursive terrain, to make visible the invisible, to voice the previously unspeakable, is breath taking.</s><s>Until recently the labelling of \"black\" or \"white\" seemed to be a faux pas, something, if you know the codes, you can only whisper behind your hand; scholars would refer to their research as having taken place in a low income area southwest of Cape Town that everyone knows is a black \"informal settlement\" (slum).</s><s>Suddenly \"black\" and \"white\" appears to be omnipresent, newly liberated signifiers in public speech. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b3\">3</ref></s><s>The conditions of coloniality on campus are at the center of the critique.</s><s>Maria Lugano describes this concept eloquently.</s></p><p><s>With the expansion of European colonialism, the classification was imposed on the population of the planet.</s><s>Since then, it has permeated every area of social existence and it constitutes the most effective form of material and inter-subjective social domination.</s><s>Thus, \"coloniality\" does not just refer to \"racial\" classification.</s><s>It is an encompassing phenomenon, since it is one of the axes of the system of power and as such it permeates all control sexual access, collective authority, labor, subjectivity/inter-subjectivity and the production of knowledge from within these inter-subjective relations.</s><s>(2010, 745)   A myriad of structural, linguistic, and cultural analyses are produced as black students express their anger and pain.</s><s>University establishments reacted initially with rejection, and then, given the immense popularity of the movement, with liberal \"repressive tolerance,\" a concept Herbert Marcuse introduced in 1968 in the context of Berkley University student protests; this potentially suffocating embrace in the sense of \"we thank our students, we learn from them, but . .</s><s>.\" was quickly replaced with outright defensiveness followed by a militarisation of campuses as the protests continued in 2016.</s><s>Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh criticized \"the people who are leading our universities\" for not encouraging debates about \"race, decolonisation and economic justice\" but to instead criminalise active students.</s><s>In an ironic distancing himself of British etiquettes, he clarifies \"by \\'debate,\\' I do not mean a \\'gentlemanly\\' exchange of views followed by tea and scones.</s><s>The debate we need to have in South Africa is loud, multilingual, fractious and unpredictable.</s><s>It involves protest, songs, dance and speech.\" 4 Achille Mbembe initially described the situation as an evolvement of new voices through which \"anger, rage, and grief seem to become the new markers of identity and agency\" and where the \"key pillars of the 1994 dispensation-a constitutional democracy, market society and non-racialism-are also under scrutiny.\"</s><s>Mbembe and the movement grew more and more antagonistic.</s><s>He wondered why whiteness as well as pain and suffering has turned into \"erotogenic objects,\" something he cautions might not lead to demythologize whiteness but on the contrary will ultimately \"end up claiming us,\" an \"us\" the students no longer take for granted as the intergenerational conflict among black young activists and their parental generation unfolds. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b5\">5</ref></s><s>This intergenerational fallout is reflected in calls to \"stop \\'uncle-ing\\' us\" and Panashe Chigumazi sums up this fallout: \"However, as things stand, where \\'our parents,\\' the generation of black intellectual and political leaders, continue to fail us by choosing respectability politics and race transcendence over the pressing demands of decolonization, that interest is no longer as keen.</s><s>They are losing the little moral authority they had.</s><s>Very soon we will not be willing to listen to them any more.\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">6</ref></s><s> argue that right now non-racialism, no longer understood in its initial apartheid context, i.e. being a political strategy, but often rather crudely reduced to a form of colour-blind politics of belonging which mostly inform white people\\'s comfortable identification with a universal, post-race South Africanness, is not a helpful strategy supporting \"transformation.\"</s><s>Non-racialism might have had its time as a contested and complex concept already during struggle days.</s><s>However today the often simplified removal of all markers of \"race,\" a social construct that not only legitimize(d) discrimination but also granted and still grants privileges, erasures the possibility to name, analyze and therefore fight the continuous symbolic and material manifestations of the \"race\" in post-apartheid South Africa.</s><s>To avoid color-conscious language and critique with the intention of unlocking black people from the position of Otherness tied to blackness means at the same time to absolve white people from acknowledging that past atrocities have been done in the name of whiteness; atrocities that are still holding them responsible today collectively and as individuals becoming white, being white, doing white-intentionally or not. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b7\">7</ref></s><s>ndoing Violence?</s><s>The \"Affective Labour of Remembering\" and \"Relational Distortions\" Wytske Versteeg follows the ideas of Emmanuel Levinas, arguing that violence is undone when it still hurts but no longer wounds: once the violated freedom possesses the full power to absolve.</s><s>Here, freedom and power are inevitably interlinked concepts.</s><s>The Latin word absolvere has a broad meaning: to free, to acquit, to complete, finish, let go, rid oneself or others of guilt.</s><s>Most of these meanings refer to an interaction between self and the other: I free you, I acquit you, I let you go.</s><s>Then there is the meaning that refers back to the self in the sense of \"I rid myself of guilt.\"</s><s>When the victim keeps the full freedom to free itself then this is a clear first step to turn a violent act into a hurt and to eventually conclude, finish and let go of the matter. <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">8</ref></s><s>Translated to the situation in South Africa, one needs to acknowledge that for many black people, freedom has not yet reached the full power to absolve white people and this is why the current generation of activists speak of \"black pain and anger.\"</s><s>The persistence of racism and racialized social inequality requires the naming of who is doing what to whom from which specific, current and historical, individual and collective, position.</s><s>As long as this is not done, that, what is done in the name of whiteness, keeps gaining the power to be still wounding.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>The Need for the Affective Labor of Remembering</head><p><s>Racial subjectivities are interrelated, both, constructed as mutually exclusive, but simultaneously reciprocally constitutive to each other.</s><s>I suggest three main consequences of this: firstly, white liberals, intimidated by black (and some white) critique of structural, everyday societal racism and their collective silence in the face of angry, right-wing, white victim discourses is problematic in itself; secondly: they therefore fail to challenge the majority of white South Africans\\' denial about whiteness\\'s global hegemony and their continuous partaking in post-apartheid/colonial systems of privilege.</s><s>As a consequence of point one and two the overwhelming majority of white people appear to be unable or unwilling to engage in a pro-active engagement with what I conceptualise as the affective labor of remembering on the side the perpetrator collective; in my view a fundamental element of post-conflict societal transitioning and healing.</s><s>As such the affective labor of remembering <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b9\">9</ref> includes forms of individual self-scrutinization of one\\'s own voluntary (and involuntarily) inclusion in dominant systems of privilege in relation to a critical reflection of one\\'s own collective social positioning (as white and /or middle class and/or heterosexual, and/or able bodied etc. . .</s><s>.) to then \"own\" one\\'s complicities and the responsibilities that come with them.</s></p><p><s>In 1967 Alexander and Magarete Mitscherlich published The Inability to Mourn: Principles of Collective Behaviour, 10 which describes German postwar society\\'s inability to mourn their owns deeds: to cope and deal with their war crimes, the guilt of the collective of perpetrators in relation to the holocaust, the collective support of the regime and of war crimes.</s><s>This inability, based on repression and denial, feed German\\'s continuous entitlement toward \"their\" lost territories in Eastern Europe.</s><s>The recognition of the separation of Germany in East and West Germany (symbolized by the wall as a consequence of losing World War II) became a taboo.</s><s>The Mitscherlichs argue that \"behind such a taboo lurks the dream that, by some unforeseeable stroke of good fortune, Germans might yet be able to recover what was earlier gambled away through criminal hubris\" (1975, 4).</s><s>It seems to me that this inability to mourn and the lack of recognition of one\\'s own deeds and the taboo and entitlement that result out of this, is reflected in white supremacists as well as in white liberals\\' denial of what has been done and is still done in the name of whiteness; a construct the former are holding up as distinct and superior and that the later declare as no more powerful or relevant in a post-racial society.</s><s>However, a part of taking responsibility for one\\'s own voluntary (or involuntary) inclusion into dominant systems of privilege and power, may they be present or past with lingering legacies, is, to collectively mourn the crimes, the violence and the lives lost in the name of whiteness. 11</s></p></div>\\n<div

Power (1996); or Michelle M. Wright, in  Becoming Black (2004), to name only a few, have argued that Western values and the notion of modernity is deeply invested and linked to colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade.</s><s>Something that cannot be conceptualized without the context of violent forms of Othering at the intersections of race with gender, class, sexuality, and religion. <ref type=\"bibr\">13</ref></s><s>That various discourses and practices of violence were not simply an aberration of enlightenment and of modern western thought but rather a condition of it has been argued also by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the 1940s in The Dialectic of Enlightenment (1940) in relation anti-Semitic forms of Othering leading to the Shoa and the Nazi death camps.</s><s>In his book Modernity and Ambivalence (1993), Zygmunt Bauman takes the critique of Enlightenment as a basis of modern thought further, arguing that its cultural and social project relies on the \"distinction between an inside (ordered, accepted) and an outside (disordered, unacceptable)\" 14 -the West and the rest.</s><s>Such critiques of Western values, developed in the context of slavery, colonialism and the holocaust, of racism and anti-Semitism, requires in the first place the capacity to endure the ambivalence of modernity in order to tackle these complicities rather than simply denying them.</s><s>I am interested in the gray zones: not the easily condemned right-wing positions of a Red October campaign or an Afriforum, but the conviction of being able to preserve one\\'s individual innocence in the face of systemic human rights atrocities from which one was (still is) in one or another way benefiting.</s><s>Even when we don\\'t look at the mainstream but at white anti-racism and non-racialism the question arises: how can one, socialized in a Eurocentric context with white privileges not become tainted with racism even if one fights it?</s><s>How do \"we\" memorize, how do we become \"we\" through memorizing-and through not memorizing-twenty-one-plus years post-apartheid?</s></p><p><s>The anthology Cultural Trauma and Collective Identity examines these questions for the African-American community in post-slavery USA.</s><s>How do we relate to others\\' memories, how do we assist or intervene in the politics of remembrance?</s><s>Germany\\'s contested journey of memorising its own deeds as a conflictual, multi-party effort is here of interest.</s></p><p><s>The first winds of progress emerged in 1968, about twenty-three years post-fascism, when the daughters and sons of those living through Nazi Germany demanded real \"denazification\" in all public spheres.</s><s>The breaking of family taboos (what did my grandfather do during the war?) happened one generation later.</s><s>It is important to note that German democratic institutions began only twenty years post-1945 to prosecute Nazi criminals in the Auschwitz Trials themselves before 1963 the allied forces conducted the trials.</s><s>In 2013 the ZDF documented that in the 1960s nearly all heads of departments in the Federal Ministry of Justice were still old Nazis. <ref type=\"bibr\">15</ref></s><s>The out of parliament opposition (APO: Außerparlamentarische Opposition) targeted the remains of Nazi-ideologies and personnel in academic and political institutions and this introduced the beginning of marginalized but visible, loud, and provocative forms of Vergangenheitsbewältigung.</s></p><p><s>Translated, this means something like to \"cope with and to work through the negative and repressed aspects of a collective past.\"</s><s>Anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism, denazification, and a cultural and social revolt went hand in hand with the emerging of a culture of memorizing.</s><s>Various and still ongoing struggles for multiple layers of remembrance, the power of definition, the lifting of taboos, breaking of silences, acknowledgment of moral and political implications and ultimately discussions of individual choice and agency, collective perpetratorship, and guilt or responsibility are resurfacing, altered, added on, discarded by new generations, and changing subject positions.</s><s>Vergangenheitsbewältigung is till today a contested space.</s><s>Only in 1985, following then-president Weizäcker\\'s historic speech, it became an official part of the project to modernize German national identity.</s><s>This large, state organised discourse is often critiqued by civil society organizations as hypocritical and too tame; rather it is mainly small scale neighbourhood projects and initiatives and new social movements who contribute to the vivid landscape of contested cultures of memory and on-going attempts to find ways to cope with the past, and who also fight against the (re)strengthening of neo-nazism.</s><s>Progressive, everchanging and evolving negotiations of how to relate to the past perhaps resist the notion that final closure and release can be achieved.</s><s>But while the holocaust (reluctantly) received public, political, and scholarly attention, nationally and internationally, colonial amnesia has not been lifted Taking responsibility for historic injustices and dealing with their legacies is and will remain unfinished business as different generations ask different questions and seek different answers.</s><s>The country I come from has been transitioning in relation to German fascism for nearly eighty years; till today it is transforming its fascist legacies, for better or worse, developing, resisting, struggling for or against a landscape of multi-layered memories.</s><s>As in today\\'s South Africa, the controversy of what actually constitutes violence, was passionately debated in the 1968 era: How to weigh the metaphorical slap into the face of all victims of the Nazi era when Germany\\'s chancellor refused to step down in 1968 when his prominent Nazi past was revealed against the public physical slap into the face by an antifascist activist in response to him not taking responsibility? <ref type=\"bibr\">17</ref></s><s>he 1960s out of parliament opposition (APO) was a multitude of movements; the student movement and the reform of universities went hand in hand with a struggle for denazification of institutions such as the education and justice system and of the social and cultural sphere.</s><s>The APO aimed to expose the socioeconomic injustices of capitalism and promoted a non-dogmatic libertarianism and modes of political organising which differed from traditional left-wing, communist party structures.</s></p><p><s>Similar to today\\'s South African student movement which (at some point) refused to continue with hierarchical leadership structures and chose to work with horizontal task teams, the 1968 movements promoted (more or less successfully) forms of alternative political organising and living: the feminist slogan of the time \"the private is political\" indicated the intersections of the so-called cultural revolution: relationships, sexuality, gender relations, and communal spaces became sites to experiment with an anti-bourgeois habitus aimed at political as well as social change.</s><s>This played out as an inter-generational conflict, as an opposition to a parental generation actively involved in or at least ambivalent toward the Nazi regime.</s><s>After the war and since the \"economic wonders years\" of the 1950s, this generation had found a comfortable niche: an \"I didn\\'t know\" narrative in combination with self-victimhood (the war, the destruction, the de-industrialisation, the hunger years, etc.) allowed for an undisturbed focus on participating in the emerging consumer society and its socially provincial and reactionary politics.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>South Africa</head><p><s>Are there similarities in white post-apartheid South Africa?</s><s>In October 2013 the self-proclaimed Red October movement surfaced.</s><s>The crowd of people, publicly organising themselves around white victimhood narratives, organised a spectacle

name of all whites.</s><s>The silent white majority positioned itself off the ground of the battlefield.</s><s>Familiar with such majority \"non-reaction,\" I published the opinion piece \"Extremism\\'s Memory Politics: Organized Amnesia.\"</s><s>My main argument was that around the world different but similar forms of white supremacy and right-wing extremism are (re)emerging; neither the left nor the so-called mainstream of society has an adequate answer to this and the narrative logics of these populist movements are similar:</s></p><p><s>Firstly, historic revisionism and denialism.</s><s>The expression \"Hitler . . .</s><s>if he would not have done this thing with the Jews . . .</s><s>but he gave us highways and decreased unemployment\" resonates with Hofmeyr saying about apartheid: \"No, I don\\'t think all of it was wrong but it couldn\\'t go on forever. . . .</s><s>Hendrik Verwoerd gave us good schools, how can I say that\\'s wrong?\"</s><s>Secondly, the delegitimizing of established parties as corrupt European or cosmopolitan elites.</s><s>I am not arguing they are not corrupt but it is interesting to see which arguments are to be found in the merger of the supposedly new true voices of \"the people\" (for instance bold anti-intellectualism, anti-cosmopolitanism, post-factual essentialism etc.).</s><s>Thirdly, the call for xenophobic exclusion and a localized \"Lager\" mentality reflected in calls for tighter internal security and border management.</s><s>All this evokes connotations of old symbolism, iconographies, and discourses of an ethnically homogeneous Volksgemeinschaft, whose conservation and continuity needs the segregation of those who belong and deserve, and those who don\\'t.</s><s>Fourthly, victimhood mentality.</s><s>Today \"illegal\" immigrants are blamed for stealing wealth and women, and consequently the UK immigrant\\'s antiracist slogan \"We are here because you were there\" serves as an unwelcome reminder of colonial rule and slavery, past regimes of theft, racism and violence.</s><s>The new legitimating narrative is a seemingly more acceptable \"Neo-Racism,\" accepting equality in principle but stressing difference in culture and mentality.</s><s>Fifth: memory-aversion.</s><s>Victim mentality is directly linked to memory politics and the revision of history.</s><s>Memory of past atrocities are unpleasant for perpetrators and bystanders, they are linked to guilt.</s><s>You are seen as a pariah in the international community, and the survivors of victimized communities remind the perpetrator collectively through their very existence of their past deeds.</s><s>As such they and future generations are perceived as dangerous and hurtful and constructed as the source of one\\'s own uneasiness.</s><s>This can lead to aggression against previously victimized collectives, now seen as a collective of perpetrators.</s><s>A framing that reinforces point four: imagining one\\'s own community as universal victim.</s></p><p><s>What makes this particularly interesting in the context of the current decolonization movement in South Africa is that Afrikaaner interest groups such as Red October resurfaced in April 2015 when green paint was thrown at the Paul Kruger statue in Pretoria.</s><s>Paul Kruger (1825-1904) was a Voortrekker and later Transvaal president and descendant of a German immigrant who came to South Africa in 1713 as a mercenary for the Dutch East India Company.</s><s>Protesters sang the apartheid national anthem and waved the old apartheid flag as they see Kruger as one of their national heritage figures, while the paint-splashers see him as a symbol of colonial violence.</s><s>Greg Nicolson commented on this as follows: \"Over 20 years into democracy, after hundreds of years of brutality, things haven\\'t changed fast enough.</s><s>The ANC could have done better, clearly, but spaces described as the avenues to opportunity, universities and professional workplaces, remain white, exclusive, often only tolerating a rainbow-nation-trickle of blacks who face extra hurdles.</s><s>If they fail, their performance reflects a race.</s><s>If they succeed, well, what an exception!</s><s>That\\'s what the protests over the statues are about.</s><s>The specific legacies of Rhodes and Kruger are largely meaningless.</s><s>They represented a system that oppressed and in a post-Apartheid society where racists only officially emerge under the extreme right-wing (or on social media), the statues are a symbol of all that remains to be done, of real transformation.</s><s>While almost everyone seems to want change, they want it without fuss, without shaking the status quo.</s><s>They want to open a conversation (maybe an inquiry?) within the current system while their symbols of being remain untouched.</s><s>But that leads to stasis, as it has, with the idea of transformation dropped into white noise.</s><s>UCT\\'s protesters have managed to do something different.</s><s>It might be messy, but this is politics, not a classroom.</s><s>The #RhodesMustFall campaign recognized One of the problems with South Africa\\'s exceptionalism is that everything seems so outrageous, exclusive and unheard off.</s><s>It is spine chilling to read the commentary section after Nicolson\\'s article but it is informative if one wants to feel the pulse of a particular sense of entitlement of some quarters of white South Africa.</s><s>This is nowadays more or less disguised in a color-blind universalism that produces the paradox of notions of collective victimisation and notions of individual innocence.</s><s>We (as white people) are suffering \"reverse racism\" but I (a colorless individual) did/do not partake in structural white privilege.</s><s>The situation in South Africa, and other countries with emerging right wing populism, reminds one of Walter Benjamin\\'s description of the dialectics of movement and standstill. 20</s><s>Some of those \"formerly [sic!] privileged\" look backward and see all that has been lost in the name of progress (human rights, equality, democracy); they feel forced into a future as they look backward.</s><s>Some of those \"formerly [sic!] disadvantaged\" 21 look backward and see all that has been supposedly lost: discrimination and inequality; but they feel trapped by

collective avoid to take part in the affective labor of remembering required for transformation particular reactions might be triggered among those historically and currently placed at the receiving end of violence done in the name of whiteness; I refer here to the universalization of a particular form of anti-Eurocentric particularism, based on de-complexified notions of (pan)-Africanness and/or \"real\" blackness in the context of celebrating an imagined cultural authenticity and purity of African/Black traditions.</s><s>As so many black feminists have argued (Gqola, Ramphalile, Davis, hooks, Wallace, Wright et al.), a critique well summarized for the USA in Gender, Race and Nationalism in Black Politics (Alexander-Floyd, 2007), black patriarchal nationalism (as any nationalism) often feeds dangerous politics of belonging and violent forms of Othering.</s><s>This Othering for the purpose of self-definition includes the targeting of black homosexuals and of black women who demand gender equality as \"unafrican.\"</s><s>This Othering also includes the chauvinism that violates migrants from elsewhere in Africa, xenophobia or afrophobia, often legitimized by \"they take our women.\"</s><s>Further more, students shared that, within some corners of the \"fees must fall\" movement, black protestors who were relatively light-skinned, were termed \"yellow bone,\" supposedly not receiving the full load of racist exclusion and violence, therefore being silenced as \"not black enough\" to speak up in the movement.</s><s>In the political sphere current governmental trends such as attempts to strengthen traditional leadership structures mimicking the Black Authorities Act as developed under the apartheid regime in 1951, or more recently, the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Bill, speak to the problematic aspects of reinventing notions of essential blackness. 22</s><s>I see white identity politics, refusing to engage in the affective labor of remembering and a particular form of black identity politics, invested in patriarchal national chauvinism, as interrelated relational distortions: partly a crude reflex of forcing to light the hidden and repressed by some of those at the receiving end of systemic racism.</s><s>To mind comes also the scandal around the former WITS University student representative Mcebo Dlamini, who claimed in April 2015 to love Hitler.</s><s>His logic: as whites are now against Hitler something has to be in for blacks.</s><s>The growing critiques from the movement\\'s margins, voiced by queer and feminist activists, speak as much to this reality as the critique of \"shading\" and other internally growing practices of Othering, division and exclusion. <ref type=\"bibr\">23</ref></s><s>The statement of a black consciousness inspired student that there is no female black full professor at Wits is however a (deliberate?)</s><s>distortion of Steve Biko\\'s understanding of blackness as a

Fanon cautioned us of the limitations of \"cultural nationalism\" and the \" negritude\\'s revivalisms\" when arguing that \"the past was not always a source of hope. . . .</s><s>To move from

a challenge for movement building-from within and also from outside.</s><s>The shift from a politically informed Black identity, as envisioned by Fanon, Biko et al., toward claiming an imagined pre-colonial \"authenticity,\" can turn out to be deeply reactionary, patriarchal and undemocratic.</s><s>Frantz Fanon foresaw this long time ago: \"The customs, traditions, beliefs, formerly denied and passed on in silence are violently valorized and affirmed.</s><s>Tradition is no longer scoffed at . . . the past, becoming henceforth a constellation of values, becomes identified with the truth.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">25</ref></s><s>If Fanon is to be taken seriously, the project of decolonization will have to find a position toward such developments in order to not be hijacked by reactionary forces within and from outside.</s><s>Liberation theory responded broadly in two different ways to the dilemma of the past in the present, noting that \"writers such as Ho Chi Minh and Frantz Fanon looked to the future, hoping that participation in the revolutionary struggle would turn colonial subjects into citizens.</s><s>Others such as Gandhi, Afghani, and even Mariategui looked to the religious traditions and institutions of the past to mobilize resistance and legitimize alternatives to the economy and political structures of the colonial state.\" 26</s><s>However, this did not always work.</s><s>Margarete Kohn and Kelly McBride describe postcolonial governance as often being a paradox, namely, that the postcolonial state was structured by the very same institutions which were designed during colonialism to subordinate and exploit the colonized.</s></p><p><s>A very contemporary application of this analysis is Mpofu-Walsh\\'s critique of the South African government that has failed to resolve the crisis of education at all levels.</s><s>He critiqued problematic loyalties, noting that this is an area where the student movements need to become more

29 Maybe we need to become comfortable with the idea that \"decolonization\" cannot be a captured in a noun.</s><s>There is no arriving at an accomplished destination; rather, as an on-going process, it can only be done again and again.</s><s>Therefore, the verb \"decolonizing\" is the appropriate concept for becoming, something that inevitably encompasses everybody: those placed at the receiving end of colonial and racial privileges, embraced or rejected, and those at the receiving end of colonial and racial discrimination, endured or fought.</s><s>I too am interested in \"the function of racism for the \\'voluntary inclusion\\' in dominant systems of power.\" <ref type=\"bibr\">30</ref></s><s>The inclusion into dominant systems of power and privilege is complex as it takes place at the intersections of our various positionalities and speaks to the ambiguity of being included and excluded at the same time: white but poor, poor but heterosexual, black but male, male but handicapped, female but white, immigrant but documented, educated professional but refugee and undocumented and so forth. . . .</s><s>The voluntariness and/or involuntariness of inclusion and the responsibilities that come it makes all this even more complex and involves all sides engaged in dominance, oppression, and resistance.</s><s>In Germany, twenty-three years after the end of German fascism, \"denazification\" and the reform of universities (as well as other public institutions) was central to the previously noted 1968 movement and its \"coping with the past.\"</s><s>This was captured by the slogan \"Beneath the [academic] gowns lingers the fug of 1,000 years,\" a reference to the Nazi motto: \"The empire of a 1,000 years,\" and resulted in universities dropping their centuries-old legacies of academic regalia, since they became identified as symbols of reactionary right-wing values.</s><s>The decolonization of symbolic orders on South African campuses has touched on many aspects and often the devil lies in ambivalent details.</s><s>Only a few years ago the SRC (student representative council) at WITS, the largest and probably most radical element among formal student organisations, wanted the institution to provide them with uniforms.</s><s>In the late 2000s they received their \"jacket of office\" and since then every new representative receives his dark blue blazer in a ceremony on the eleventh floor, the offices of the usually reviled management of the university-the vice chancellor and his four deputies.</s><s>Resembling the obligatory school uniform, another colonial legacy, inducting children into embodying bourgeois manners necessary for the replication of such institutions, the new SRC insignia of distinction too mimic this symbolic order and its legacies-otherwise critiqued.</s><s>This small everyday example speaks to the aspiration of \"becoming,\" of imagining, to speak with Morrison.</s><s>As such this is a paradox imaginary, symbolizing the partaking in rituals which are at odds with the transformation of the very same structures that denied access on the basis of race, class and gender formerly, but also, by appropriating these codes of distinction, subverting a still existing dominant order of exclusion.</s><s>How one relates to this appropriation might be based on one\\'s own positionality and how this shapes one social and political identities; how the legacies of the violence of past regimes are experienced, individually and collectively, in the present, influences the rejection, subversion,

to make this connection allows for mourning to be transformed into activity: namely the partaking in the dismantling of the very same structures of privilege one (still) benefits from.</s><s>This affective labor of remembering and mourning ultimately allows to feel empathy with the violated, a powerful act of recognition.</s><s>Every context produces different strategies of denial and remembering, of complicity and resistance.</s><s>The respective global contexts within which Germany and South Africa each transitioned 33 from conflict to post-conflict were strikingly different and these contrasts bear consideration:</s></p><p><s>Whereas Germany has been liberated from itself by others (something that was only acknowledged officially in 1985), South Africa was liberated by members of the suppressed majority collective (with the support of some members of the perpetrating collective).</s><s>Given the evolving cold war scenario, the West made sure that West Germany would not fall to the Eastern block and, after an initial deindustrialisation, pumped millions of dollars (via the Marshall Plan) into the country.</s><s>This transition needed to succeed; Western powers were still worried forty-five years later, at the time of its reunification, about Germany\\'s destructive potential.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to this, the new democratic government of South Africa, run by the formerly suppressed, had to repay the debts of its suppressors while the whole world, in need of a happy ending, celebrated the rainbow narrative.</s><s>There was no internationally organised re-education for white South Africans, no \"Persilschein\" 34 issued for not having issued the dompas, for not having stuck pencils in someone\\'s hair, for not having bombed the frontline states, for not having prosecuted in the name of apartheid law.</s><s>In the German case, the extermination and exiling of victim collectives had taken place at an industrial scale and as a consequence the newly democratised West Germany was a country primarily filled with perpetrators, bystanders and their offspring: the unique situation arose, where the perpetrator collective was forced by its own succeeding generation(s), in conjunction with an international community, to remember its own deeds.</s></p><p><s>In democratic South Africa, the perpetrating collective is in the minority; it is the victimised majority which has liberated itself and is now ruling the country politically; it is their offspring, the so-called born free who now argue to not be free of the unjust material residues of the past, the dominant symbolic orders of coloniality and of the intergenerational transmission of trauma; this generation connects the notion of being free with the affective labor of remembering as a crucial form of working toward a substantial change in the current symbolic order and order of distribution.</s><s>They engage in this labor and they demand others to do so, too.</s></p><p><s>It remains an open question if the white minority will embrace its own decolonization, if their offspring will begin to ask necessary and uncomfortable questions and if the current project of decolonization will be able to save itself from the pitfalls of dogmatism and chauvinistic identity politics.</s><s>Gayatri C.

Individuals, households and groups of peasants may now purchase equipment and use credit to finance productive activities. In agri-culture, under the specialised and production contracting types of responsi-bility system, the collectives provide investment funds and stipulate their use, while under &apos;contracting in a big way&apos; it is the peasants&apos; own responsibility to invest in the land and the annual crop. Division of the Social Product The state still has the first claim on the social product through taxation. And the collectives still have the next claim for their own accumulation which they exercise either by retaining a share of output before setting aside a distribution fund (under the specialised and production contracting responsibility systems which use work points) or by stipulating rent-like payments in &apos;contracting in a big way&apos;. Then comes the share for distribution to the peasant producers. Under specialised and production contracting, this share is still subject to collective mediation, since it is allocated in the form of work points which are a claim on a share of the collective distributable income. The use of bonuses and penalties in these systems complicates matters. The most extreme depar-ture from this principle of collective determination occurs under &apos;contracting in a big way&apos;, where peasants&apos; incomes are simply the residual of what they have produced after remitting their taxes and quotas. But in the more moderate forms of responsibility system, it is mistaken to think that collective distri-bution of income has been abolished. It has not. But there probably has been a marked attenuation of the extent to which this collective mediation of income is subject to collective determination and control. Under high collectivism, decisions about income distribution - how much collective income to distri-bute, what distributive criteria to use and how to apply them - were often subject to lively mass participation. They were based upon and in turn provided the basis for direct mass supervision of the work process. Under contractual collectivism, the contracting process is probably less subject to collective democratic participation, although for now this can only be an hypothesis for future research. Whatever the case may be, where peasants&apos; incomes are, under the specialised and production contract responsibility systems, still subject to collective mediation (through the work point), peasants have lost much of their capacity to control or influence the collective actions through which their incomes are mediated. This may well be another aspect of their major contradiction discussed above: that peasants must depend on each other but have no means of controlling each other. Exchange State determination of almost all prices has now given way to a more variegated pricing structure. For certain basic staples (like grain and cotton), prices remain under close state regulation although they have been adjusted to improve incentives and take greater account of scarcities. For other products, prices have been allowed to seek levels more closely in accord with shadow</title>\\n\\t\\t<idno type=\"DOI\">10.4324/9780203043493-12</idno>\\n\\t\\t<idno>14:58:17</idno>\\n\\t\\t<ptr target=\"https://about.jstor.org/terms\" />\\n\\t</analytic>\\n\\t<monogr>\\n\\t\\t<title level=\"m\">The Agrarian Question in Socialist Transitions</title>\\n\\t\\t<imprint>\\n\\t\\t\\t<publisher>Routledge</publisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t<date type=\"published\" when=\"2024-11-19\">19 Nov 2024</date>\\n\\t\\t\\t<biblScope unit=\"volume\">50</biblScope>\\n\\t\\t\\t<biblScope unit=\"page\" from=\"123\" to=\"132\" />\\n\\t\\t</imprint>\\n\\t</monogr>\\n</biblStruct>\\n\\n<biblStruct xml:id=\"b10\">\\n\\t<analytic>\\n\\t\\t<title level=\"a\" type=\"main\">Op_Ed: Statues of Thought and Symbols of change</title>\\n\\t\\t<author>\\n\\t\\t\\t<persName><forename type=\"first\">Greg</forename><surname>Nicolson</surname></persName>\\n\\t\\t</author>\\n\\t</analytic>\\n\\t<monogr>\\n\\t\\t<title level=\"j\">Daily Maverick</title>\\n\\t\\t<imprint>\\n\\t\\t\\t<date type=\"published\" when=\"2009\">2015.

type=\"bibr\">(2001)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(2002)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(2003)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(2004)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(2005)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(2006)</ref> ABSTR ACT After having presented a brief overview of the relationship between Italy and Israel since its founding to the 1990s, this article analyses the reasons why the Berlusconi government decided to change the Italian foreign policy towards Israel, moving from a more pro-Palestinian stance to a clearly pro-Israel one.</s><s>The international situation after 9/11 and the new state of affairs of Italian politics following the birth of the so-called Second Republic might explain such a turning-point.</s><s>In particular, the post-fascist Alleanza Nazionale (AN) party was looking for legitimization by the Italian Jewish communities in order to present itself as a modern European right-wing party.</s><s>Thus, AN decided to openly support Israel, thus pushing the entire government towards this position.</s><s>At the same time, the birth of an Islamophobic milieu made relevant sectors of the civil society back Israel, as part of the wider battle that \"the West\" is conducting against \"the Muslim fundamentalism\".</s></p><p><s>Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi\\'s visit to Israel on 1-3 February 2010 (his third)1 was, apart from a minor incident,2 unanimously considered a huge success.</s><s>Berlusconi was welcomed warmly; he met President Shimon Peres, participated with eight Italian ministers in a joint cabinet meeting with the Israeli government, and was invited to speak at the Knesset, where he was interrupted twelve times by complimentary applause.</s><s>Before giving the floor to Berlusconi, PM Benjamin Netanyahu had enthusiastic words for his guest:</s></p><p><s>You are a courageous leader who stands by Israel at all times. . . .</s><s>Under your leadership, Italy is spearheading Europe\\'s battle against anti-Semitism and the battle to preserve the memory of the Holocaust. . . .</s><s>Under your leadership, the relations between our peoples and countries have further developed and deepened.</s><s>Italy has become one of Israel\\'s closest friends in Europe and the world. . . .</s><s>Israel knows that it has a great friend in Europe, in the shape of Silvio Berlusconi. . . .</s><s>In the name of all the people of Israel, I want to say to you: we respect you, we embrace you, and we love you.</s><s>Welcome to <ref type=\"bibr\">Jerusalem.3</ref></s><s>This was not the first time the Italian-Israeli relationship was defined in such a good way.</s><s>Seven years earlier, between 17 and 19 November 2003, PM Ariel Sharon visited Rome.</s><s>During an informal meeting with members of Rome\\'s Jewish community, he reportedly stated that \"Italy is today the best friend that we have in Europe . . .</s><s>We have never had a country holding the EU presidency that has been as friendly as Italy today.\"4</s><s>If Berlusconi\\'s warm reception in Israel in February 2010 was not surprising, given the excellent relations between Italy and Israel in the last decade, such a path is totally unexpected if we compare the current situation and the previous fifty years of political relationship between the two countries, which were never particularly friendly and close.</s></p><p><s>Before entering the core of this article-i.e., an analysis of the reasons why Berlusconi radically changed Italian foreign policy towards Israel and, as a consequence, the Arab world-the next pages will briefly present an overview of the relationship between Italy and Israel, in order to prove why the Berlusconi government\\'s stance towards Israel can be interpreted as a major turning-point compared to the traditional Italian pro-Arab foreign policy.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>ITALIAN-ISR AELI RELATIONS-AN OVERVIEW</head><p><s>Analysis of the relationship between Italy and Israel has been largely neglected by both Italian5 and foreign historiography, and it is therefore possible to enlist only a few academic articles that focus on this topic.6</s><s>Only in recent years has the situation partially changed, and some interesting volumes and articles have been published in Italy, either regarding specific moments of the Italian-Israeli relationship,7 or concerning specific topics, mainly the attitude of the Italian left-wing parties towards Israel and the Palestinians.8</s><s>Despite some relevant exceptions, the most famous of which are certainly the Republican Party, the Partito Repubblicano Italiano (PRI), and the Radical Party, the Partito Radicale,9 it is possible to summarize the first fifty years of diplomatic relations between Israel and Italy as characterized by a formal and cold friendship that neither upgraded to become closer or warmer, nor registered heavy tensions.</s><s>It was clearly Italy\\'s choice, since it did not want its relationship with Israel to harm relations with the Arab world.</s><s>A useful and appropriate expression that has been employed by historiography to summarize the Italian position toward Israel depicts the Italian-Israeli relationship as carried out \"under the Arab states\\' shadow\".10</s><s>In fact, the Italian government carefully avoided any policy toward Israel that might have created obstacles-even minor ones-to the relationship with the Arab world, both political and economic.</s></p><p><s>Rome has maintained a low-profile policy towards Israel since 1948.</s><s>From this point of view, Italy was helped by not being part of the UN (it was accepted as a member only in 1955) during the 29 November 1947 UNGA vote on Resolution 181, which became the legal basis for the birth of Israel the following year.</s><s>On that occasion, the Italian government did not need to take any stand.</s><s>Later, it maintained a low-profile position by recognizing Israel cautiously.</s><s>Similar to the United States-Washington extended de facto recognition to Israel on 14 May 1948 and de jure recognition on 31 January 1949-Italian de facto recognition was accorded on 7 February 1949 following Israel\\'s first general election on January 25.</s><s>Italy acknowledged Israel\\'s exercising control over the territory it conquered, but waited for the situation to become clearer.</s><s>De jure recognition was granted only the following year, on 19 January 1950.11</s><s>Since then, the Italian government remained very careful to not take any step that might have ruined the strong relationship it was building with the Arab world.</s><s>It was actually Israel\\'s willingness to develop a closer alliance with Italy that led to the visit of FM Moshe Sharett to Rome in March 1952 and an economic agreement between the two countries two years later.12</s><s>Even on this occasion, the Italian government was wary not to endanger its partnership with the Arab world.</s><s>In particular, Rome made it clear that the oil coming from the Gulf countries would not be sold to Israel; thus the embargo that the Arab League had put on Israel would have not been circumvented.</s><s>This trend did not change during the 1950s.</s><s>On the contrary, it was corroborated by the so-called neoatlantismo,13 the new-Atlantic policy that aimed at confirming the closeness between Italy and the United States, yet allowing Rome to conduct a more autonomous policy in the Mediterranean region.</s><s>A further strengthening of this attitude took place after the June 1967 war, when Italy started carrying out a more defined pro-Arab policy.</s><s>Under the direction of Aldo Moro (one of the most relevant politicians of the leading Christian Democratic party, the Democrazia Cristiana (DC), who was FM almost continuously between 1969 and 1974), though theoretically maintaining equidistanza (i.e., being equally distant from both sides), Italy increased its pro-Arab orientation.</s></p><p><s>The government was also backed by the Communist opposition party, the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI), in line with the USSR policy in the Middle East.</s><s>Since the second half of the 1970s, such a strategy was even more evident, mainly due to the economic crisis following the 1973 oil shock.</s><s>At the same time, Italy started having a marked pro-Palestinian stance, as demonstrated by the 1974 opening of a PLO representative office in Rome, despite it formally being part of the Arab League delegation.14</s><s>A few years later, in June 1980, it was also thanks to the effort of FM Emilio Colombo15 that the European Council adopted the Venice Declaration on the Middle East, which recognized \"the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination\" and \"the involvement and support of all the parties concerned in the peace settlement\" including the PLO, which also had \"to be associated with the negotiations\".16</s></p><p><s>During the 1980s, the Socialist Party, the Partito Socialista Italiano (PSI), briefly led coalition governments.</s><s>Under Bettino Craxi\\'s governments <ref type=\"bibr\">(1983)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(1984)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(1985)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(1986)</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(1987)</ref>, a further strengthening of the Italian-Arab relationship and of the Italian pro-Palestinian attitude took place.</s><s>Notwithstanding the first visit ever of an Israeli prime minister (Shimon Peres) to Italy in February 1985,17 several events underlined the increasing relationship between Rome and the PLO.</s><s>In December 1984,18 Craxi went to Tunis to meet PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and the following year Italy harshly denounced the Israeli raid in Tunis.</s><s>In October 1985 the Italian-Israeli relationship reached its lowest point, with the famous episode of the Achille Lauro affair.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">19</ref> Finally, in the 1990s, a revolution in Italian domestic policy took place, the end of the so-called First Republic.</s><s>The two main government parties, DC and PSI, collapsed due to a nationwide judicial investigation into corruption; a complete change in the Italian political parties\\' spectrum took place, and new political forces arose.</s><s>Due to this internal political transformation and to the Oslo peace process, Italian foreign policy towards Israel started to change, thus reaching a more balanced stance regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s><s>Yet, it was only with the Berlusconi government that Italian foreign policy experienced a real shift.</s><s>It is particularly interesting to focus on the reasons why Ruggiero decided to resign.</s><s>Before entering Italian politics, he had been Director General of the World Trade Organization.</s><s>Apparently, he had been appointed FM due to the pressure of the President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and other sectors of the Italian establishment, the most prominent of whom was Gianni Agnelli, FIAT\\'s owner.20 Ruggiero decided to leave the government only a few months after his appointment, because of the skepticism expressed by other ministries-mainly Defense Minister Antonio Martino, Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti, and Reforms Minister Umberto Bossi-towards the EU,21 in particular regarding adoption of the new currency, the euro, which became effective on 1 January 2002.</s><s>As Ruggiero made clear, he resigned because he did not agree with the \"discontinuity\" in Italian foreign policy, i.e., the much too pronounced pro-Washington stance that, in his opinion, the entire government was pursuing.22</s><s>Yet, when Berlusconi became FM and addressed the Italian Parliament on 14 January 2002, he stressed the government\\'s \"continuity\" with the past, which was evident in his strategy of strengthening Rome\\'s partnership both with the European Union and the United States.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">23</ref> Did Berlusconi\\'s foreign policy demonstrate \"continuity\" or \"discontinuity\" with previous Italian behavior?</s><s>Was Ruggiero right in believing that Berlusconi had given more importance to the relationship with the United States, thus marginalizing the one with the EU, or was Berlusconi correct in stating that he had maintained a strong liaison both with Brussels and Washington?</s><s>A significant number of studies have been published on this topic,24 and as Elisabetta Brighi states, \"The literature is divided between those who argue that Berlusconi has changed Italian foreign policy and those who, on the contrary, tend to see more continuity (typically conceding that the style and rhetoric have perhaps changed, but the substance has not).\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">25</ref> Pietro Ignazi states the \"discontinuity\" argument.</s><s>According to him, despite declaring that the main direction of his policy was to strengthen the relationship with both sides-the United States and the EU-Berlusconi ended by clearly identifying Italian national interests with a stricter loyalty to Washington compared to Brussels.26</s><s>Ettore Greco, Director of the Institute for International Affairs of Rome, also agrees with the idea that Berlusconi acted in \"discontinuity\" with the previous foreign policy.</s><s>According to him, the EU was perceived by the Italian government \"more as a common economic space than a cohesive political entity.\"27</s><s>Thus, Berlusconi detached its policy from the traditional approach Italy had towards Europe, i.e., aiming at strengthening its political role.28</s><s>Former diplomat Sergio Romano notes a \"turnover of the traditional priorities\" when Rome decided to set its relationship with the United States at the top of its priorities.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">29</ref> Differing with this view, Osvaldo Croci believes in the \"continuity\" of Berlusconi\\'s foreign policy, \"If the Berlusconi government has brought changes to Italian foreign policy, they concern its tone and style and not its substance.\"30</s><s>In particular, the war in Iraq is interpreted by Croci as a proof of \"continuity\", rather than of \"discontinuity\".</s><s>In fact, as much as it did other times in the past, Rome tried to mediate between two positions, specifically the one led by the United States, on one side, and the France-Germany axis, on the other.</s><s>As Croci states, \"The position of the Berlusconi government on the Iraqi question . . .</s><s>[wa]s not something new, but simply the latest manifestation of a well-established policy choice based on what [Leopoldo] Nuti has called \\'an almost structural inclination\\' of Italy to look towards Washington with the same intensity with which it looks over the Alps and across the Mediterranean.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">\"31</ref> Literature is also divided between those who consider the Berlusconi government\\'s Mediterranean policy in terms of \"continuity\" and those who highlight its \"discontinuity\".32</s><s>According to Valter Coralluzzo, it \"was, in essence, not as dissimilar from previous Italian policy\".</s><s>Since \"alignment to the position taken by the United States government [is] . . .</s><s>one of the main inspirations (if not the principal guide) to Italian Mediterranean policy\", Coralluzzo believes that Berlusconi did not behave in an innovative way, but his policy followed a consolidated tradition.</s><s>Yet, an \"exception\" was represented by the Italian government taking into \"careful consideration . . . the interests and concerns of the state of Israel\".33 Differently, according to Maurizio Carbone, a clear sign of discontinuity was represented by Berlusconi\\'s choice to agree with \"Bush\\'s theory that security in the Mediterranean depended on the democratic transformation of the regimes in the region\".34</s><s>This was quite in contrast with a traditional attitude of the Italian government, based on the idea not to interfere in the Mediterranean countries\\' political affairs.</s><s>Finally, Raffaella Del Sarto and Nathalie Tocci believe that Italian policy in the Mediterranean and the Middle East \"underwent a visible shift\", specifically regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, since the Italian government ended by \"siding unreservedly and uncritically with Israel\\'s Ariel Sharon.\"</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">35</ref> Given the different opinions, it is not simple to answer the question whether it is more correct to read Berlusconi\\'s foreign policy according to a paradigm of \"continuity\" rather than according to one of \"discontinuity\".</s><s>However, it is possible to identify one specific issue in regard to which Berlusconi certainly radically changed the traditional Italian foreign policy, not only formally, but also substantially: the relationship with Israel.</s></p><p><s>A slight change in the Italian position towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had already been carried out by the center-left wing governments in 1996-2001.</s><s>In particular, it was the Left Democratic Party (Democratici di Sinistra), the most relevant in the center-left government coalition that played a relevant role in such a change.</s><s>In April 1999, there was a meeting between PM Massimo D\\'Alema and FM Ariel Sharon during the latter\\'s official visit to Rome.</s><s>D\\'Alema stated that Italy was interested in conducting a more balanced policy, whose main aim was supporting the on-going peace process.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">36</ref> Compared to what had happened in the 1970s and 1980s, this center-left government decided to concretely carry out the equidistanza towards Israel and the Palestinians that Italy had only theoretically pursued in the previous decades.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">37</ref> However, when Berlusconi took power in 2001, he completely transformed traditional Italian foreign policy, and adopted a clearly pro-Israeli stance.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>THE TURNING POINT IN ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS ISR AEL</head><p><s>It is important to point out some relevant episodes that confirm that Italian foreign policy toward Israel represents a clear sign of \"discontinuity\" compared to the past.</s><s>The first is the proposal of a \"Marshall Plan for Palestine\", formalized during a speech Berlusconi delivered on 5 February 2002, soon after his temporary appointment as FM.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b36\">38</ref> This massive aid plan to the Palestinians39 was driven more by a humanitarian approach than by a political one.</s><s>The idea that was behind it recalls a long-lasting Israeli assumption, according to which Palestinians\\' economic development is the key that leads to the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b37\">40</ref> The decision of the Italian government represented a major shift of the traditional policy Rome had towards the conflict, which in previous decades had mainly focused on the political issue of the Palestinians\\' right to self-determination.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b38\">41</ref> Another episode that confirms the new Italian stance took place a few months later, on 15 April 2002.</s><s>Italy refused to endorse Resolution E/CN.4/2002/L.16,42</s><s>proposed by the UN Commission for Human Rights (UNCHR).</s><s>According to the Italian delegate, it was not possible to approve such a document, since it was condemning the Israeli violations of the Palestinians\\' human rights without even mentioning Palestinian terrorist attacks against the Israeli population.</s><s>Germany and the United Kingdom, traditionally very cautious in criticizing the Israeli policy, voted against the resolution.</s><s>Austria, Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden voted in favor.</s><s>Italy and Poland abstained.</s><s>The Italian government was very clear in stating that, starting from that moment, if future resolutions were not more balanced, Italy would not endorse them.</s></p><p><s>A few months later, Berlusconi took another step, which confirmed the new Italian attitude towards Israel.</s><s>On 11 December 2002, during Israeli President Moshe Katzav\\'s visit to Rome, the Italian PM declared that since April 2002 there had been no direct contact with the Palestinian Authority.</s><s>According to both the Israeli Embassy in Rome, and the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, Berlusconi stated that the Italian government\\'s \"doors had been closed to Arafat soon after the Netanya massacre.\"43</s><s>Actually, this was not true because Gianni Letta, the PM Office\\'s Under Secretary, had met the PA Minister for Cooperation, Nabil Sha\\'at, a few weeks earlier.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b41\">44</ref> Regardless, this statement was a further demonstration of the Italian government\\'s intention to strongly back the Israeli position by undermining the Palestinian Authority at an international level.</s></p><p><s>In June 2003-a few weeks before Rome took over the presidency of the EU-the Italian government made two other decisions that fostered its warmer relationship with Israel.</s><s>On one hand, a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation in the military and defense sectors was signed on 16 June and approved by the Italian Parliament in February 2005.</s><s>For the first time in Italian-Israel relations they had agreed to carry out cooperation in relevant and quite sensitive fields, such as defense, security, and scientific research for civilian and military purposes.</s><s>During his second visit to Israel, Berlusconi refused to schedule a meeting with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat.</s><s>It was quite unusual behavior for a European leader not to meet any Palestinian representative.</s><s>For this reason, the Italian decision was highly criticized by other EU members, who had openly expressed their position against the marginalization of Arafat from Palestinian political life that Israel-which had declared him irrelevant-was pursuing.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b42\">45</ref> In September 2003, during the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council held in Riva del Garda, there was another important event.</s><s>FM Franco Frattini coordinated with the other EU representatives to include Hamas in the list of terrorist groups, as the United States had already done in January 1995.</s><s>It was exactly the opposite behavior to that of the Italian government in Venice in June 1980, when FM Colombo was active in making the European Community decide to consider the PLO a political organization, and not a terrorist one.</s><s>Apparently, Frattini had promised Israeli FM Silvan Shalom that he would take advantage of Italy being the host country of the meeting to convince other European states, particularly France, to list Hamas as a terrorist organization.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b43\">46</ref> Nothing changed after Gianfranco Fini\\'s appointment as FM in November 2004.</s><s>Clearly-as we will see later-it could not have been otherwise, since the political party he was leading, Alleanza Nazionale (AN), had played a major role in changing Italian foreign policy towards Israel.</s><s>Moreover, on 11 November 2003, while he was Deputy PM, Fini told La Stampa that he understood Israel\\'s decision to build the security barrier,47 despite the EU having taken a common position condemning its construction.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b45\">48</ref> A few days before being appointed FM, on 11 November 2004, Fini, interviewed in La Stampa, commented on the death of Yasser Arafat, in line with the position of the Israeli establishment, stating \"This is a historical day for Israel\\'s security.\"49</s><s>The idea of Arafat\\'s death being a very positive event for Israel was shared by the rest of the Italian government, which was planning to participate in Arafat\\'s funeral with a low-profile delegation.</s><s>In the end, after President Ciampi pressed Berlusconi to send a more significant representation, Senate President Marcello Pera, Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno, and Foreign Affairs Under-Secretary Alfredo Mantica attended the funeral ceremony in Cairo.</s><s>The strong \"discontinuity\" with the past is evident, since both Bettino Craxi and Giulio Andreotti, who was FM for most of the 1980s, considered Arafat as a head of state and treated him in this way, despite the PLO still being considered by Israel as a terrorist organization.</s></p><p><s>During his third visit to Israel, in an interview with The Jerusalem Post on 22 December 2004, Fini attacked the EU\\'s biased attitude towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and declared that European governments and public opinion should change their stance, by starting to understand Israeli positions, instead of having an ideological and biased approach towards the Jewish state.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b48\">50</ref> Finally, after the Hamas victory in the Parliamentary elections in January 2006, Berlusconi completely backed Israel in considering such an event \"a very, very, very bad result\"51 and in pushing the EU to abide by its decision not to recognize the Hamas government if it did not accept the three conditions Brussels had imposed: recognition of Israel, acceptance of all past agreements signed by the PLO, and the commitment to end violence.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>WHY DID SUCH A CHANGE HAPPEN? AN INTERPRETATION</head><p><s>Among the reasons that explain the turning point in Italian foreign policy towards Israel, the economic relationship does not seem to have played a major role.</s><s>Certainly, there was a boost in the trade exchange between the two countries: in 2004, Italian exports to Israel increased by 12% to a total of $1.6 billion, while imports from Israel increased by 8%, to a total of $831 billion.</s><s>By 2007, Italy had become Israel\\'s fourth largest world trading partner in terms of exports, and its fifth largest world partner in terms of imports.52</s><s>Yet, such a trend can be considered a consequence of the closer political liaison between the two countries, rather than one of its causes.</s></p><p><s>The reasons for what has been described so far are definitively political and ideological.</s><s>In particular, there are two aspects that have to be taken into consideration.53</s><s>The first has to do with Italian foreign policy: the closeness to the United States that characterized Berlusconi\\'s policy almost automatically turned into a full pro-Israeli stance.</s><s>The second and more relevant aspect is related to Italian domestic policy, and specifically to two phenomena: the birth of pro-Israeli political parties after the end of the so-called First Republic, mainly Alleanza Nazionale (AN), i.e., the heir of Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI), a post-Fascist party; and the creation of an ideological and cultural milieu, which is characterized by being Islamophobic and progressively more and more pro-Israeli.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>ItalIan ForeIgn PolIcy: From WashIngton to Jerusalem</head><p><s>Traditionally, according to the so-called theory of the \"three circles\",54 Italian foreign policy has been the result of a balance between the \"first circle\", i.e., the relationship with Washington, the \"second circle\", i.e., the presence in the European institutions (previously the European Community, and later the EU), and the \"third circle\", i.e., the orientation towards the Mediterranean region and the Arab world.</s><s>Since the end of the Second World War, Rome tried-and actually succeeded-to have a close alliance with the United States, while maintaining autonomy in the other two circles.</s></p><p><s>Berlusconi challenged such a balance and gave precedence to the U.S. circle, which ended up reducing the margins of autonomy in the other two circles.55</s><s>He decided that the Italian priority in foreign policy should have been represented by a strong alliance with Washington.</s><s>That meant that the new Bush course of \"war on terror\" would have been fully supported by the Italian government.</s></p><p><s>The direct consequence of this pro-U.S. stance was Italy establishing a much closer relationship with Israel.</s><s>In particular, the most relevant aspect was that the Israeli battle against Palestinian terrorism was interpreted by the Berlusconi government-exactly as both the United States and Israel were doing-as part of the fight that the \"Western and democratic world\" was conducting after September 11 to defend itself against the Islamist jihadist attack.</s><s>This was actually one of the main successes of the Israeli government-presenting the Palestinian suicide terrorism during the Second Intifada as a matter of \"global jihad\", not different from the September 11 events.</s></p><p><s>For this reason, when FM Benjamin Netanyahu visited Italy on 18-19 December 2002, Frattini stated that \"The terror campaign conducted against Israel by the radical factions through suicide attacks had no moral justification at all, and represented the main danger for any democracy, all over the world.\"56</s><s>Thus, according to the Italian government, backing Israel meant supporting and defending western democracy and its values from Islamist attack.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>BeIng \"medIator\" In the IsraelI-PalestInIan conFlIct</head><p><s>According to Berlusconi-as he stated in the foreword to the volume by Ehud Gol, Israeli ambassador to Italy between 2001 and 200657-the reason for a change in the traditional Italian policy toward Israel lay in the idea of increasing the EU role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, so that the EU could stop being mainly a \"payer\" and become also a \"player\".</s><s>In order to do that, the Italian PM believed that the EU had to adjust its policy, by balancing its biased anti-Israel stance.</s><s>According to the traditional self-perception of Italy as a \"diplomatic mediator\", and to the new approach that Berlusconi introduced in Italian diplomacy, that of establishing personal friendship-based relations with other countries\\' leaders, Berlusconi thought that Italy could lead Europe to have a more balanced position and, therefore, to take a more active role in mediation.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b56\">58</ref> Regardless of the actual effectiveness of this strategy-totally unrealistic-it is important to stress that given the absolutely pro-U.S. stance of Berlusconi\\'s foreign policy, the consequence of such a proposal would have been that of leading the EU to take the U.S. position, thus decreasing the role the EU could concretely play in the peace process.</s><s>Somehow, this is what happened in 2003, with the decision to identify Hamas as a terrorist organization, and in 2006, with the choice to boycott the Hamas-led government.</s><s>In both cases, the EU passively followed the United States and lost the chance of creating a real alternative to the American policy.</s><s>Moreover, Berlusconi\\'s attempt to lead Europe towards a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict actually resulted in alienating the EU on at least two occasions-when Berlusconi refused to meet Arafat in June 2003, and when Fini expressed understanding for the Israeli decision to build the separation barrier in November 2003.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>ItalIan domestIc

place in the Italian context.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>alleanza nazIonale\\'s Pro-IsraelI stance</head><p><s>The first occurrence has to do with the legitimacy that Gianfranco Fini was seeking for his newly created political party, Alleanza Nazionale (AN), born out of the former post-Fascist party.59</s><s>In order to demonstrate that AN no longer had anything to do with Fascism, Fini was looking for a sort of \"whitewash\" that could affirm the new status of AN as a modern European-style right-wing party.</s><s>No one could provide him with such a \"patent\" better than the Italian Jewish community.</s><s>Starting from the October 1993 Rome municipality elections, Fini aimed at receiving a \"seal of legitimacy\" from the Italian Jewish community in order to be able to play a governmental role in alliance with Berlusconi\\'s party, Forza Italia (FI).</s></p><p><s>The \"privileged tool\" that Fini chose in order to get that legitimacy was an almost unconditional support of Israel, its government and its politics, in particular concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s></p><p><s>It is not by chance that during the Fiuggi congress, in January 1995, which officially confirmed the birth of AN, it was declared: AN condemns explicitly, definitively and without appeal any form of anti-Semitism and anti-Judaism, even when they are disguised by the propagandistic anti-Zionist and anti-Israeli policy. . . .</s><s>Any prejudice has also to be condemned, since it was the preparation for anti-Semitic propaganda that led to pogroms and the Shoah.</s><s>AN totally agrees with the Second Vatican Council declaration Nostra Aetate, and with John Paul II\\'s positions towards Jews, our \"older brothers and sisters\".</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b57\">60</ref> This was the key that Fini used in the following years: nothing would have facilitated the dialogue with the Italian Jewish communities more than the total backing of the Israeli government and a strong denunciation of the anti-Israeli position of left-wing parties, especially the so-called \"radical left\".</s></p><p><s>It is through this lens that the long journey that Fini made to get the legitimacy he needed to become a full member of Italian politics has to be read.</s><s>On one hand, Fini totally condemned Fascist anti-Semitism, from the racial laws to the Jews\\' deportation, up to the Shoah.</s><s>For this reason, he made a series of highly symbolic gestures: in December 1993 he visited the memorial of the Fosse Ardeatine, which commemorates the massacre that the Nazis carried out in Rome in March 1944; in February 1999 he went to Auschwitz, and later to the Risiera di San Sabba, the only extermination camp located in Italy, close to Trieste; in October 2002 he met Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff.</s><s>On the other hand, starting from 1994, AN totally sided with Israel and backed its politics.</s><s>In a long interview with Ha\\'aretz, 13 September 2002, in which he asked for forgiveness for the racial laws of 1938 and the tragic events that followed, he also explained his political path from post-Fascism to AN.</s><s>The following year, on 24 November 2003, Fini went to Israel.</s></p><p><s>His visit was the fulfillment of a political process started ten years earlier.</s><s>In Israel, Fini visited Yad Vashem, met the Italian Jewish community in Israel, and had a meeting with PM Sharon.</s><s>Thus, the two different tracksbridging the gap with the Italian Jewish communities by denouncing Fascist wickedness, and being perceived by Israel as a close ally-reached their goal, and Fini and AN became a reference point both for Italian Jews and the Israeli government.</s></p><p><s>The AN pro-Israeli attitude highly influenced the Berlusconi government\\'s foreign policy, not only in the two years Fini was FM, but during the entire half-decade of government.</s><s>This is particularly true because Forza Italia and Legal Nord, for different reasons, did not have any specific position towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s><s>As to FI, it is not far from the truth to say that this party is completely shaped by Berlusconi: it is totally up to him to dictate the party\\'s agenda, specifically concerning foreign policy.</s><s>Since Berlusconi decided to have a pro-Israeli stance, the entire party followed his position.</s><s>As to Legal Nord, this is mainly a domestic-oriented party, whose positions regarding foreign policy are totally dependent on internal issues.</s><s>Its EU skepticism was mainly if not totally related to the fact that the euro, being stronger than the Italian lira, was making it more difficult for Northern private enterprises to export; at the same time, its tough position against China is related to the crisis of the textiles in Italy, due to the competition with Chinese cheap products.</s><s>Lega Nord did not have any specific position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict until September 11, when it viewed the Middle Eastern reality through the lens of a domestic politics issue-its opposition to the increasing presence of Muslim immigrants in Italy.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b58\">61</ref> an IslamoPhoBIc Pro-IsraelI mIlIeu: \"We are Israel\"; \"long lIve Israel\"</s></p><p><s>The second process that explains the change that occurred in Italian foreign policy towards Israel has to do with a slow-yet increasing-cultural and ideological trend: the birth of an Islamic prejudice in large sectors of the Italian public opinion and political spectrum especially among right-wing parties.</s></p><p><s>Fear of the growing Islamic presence in Italy-due to migrationbecame a widespread Islamophobic tendency after the events of September 11.</s><s>At the same time, between 2002 and 2006, Israel became part of the related discourse.</s><s>During these four years, some journalists and intellectuals succeeded in presenting the existence of a link between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the jihadist attack against the West.</s><s>In particular, the Second Intifada (specifically the devastating series of suicide bombing attacks against Israel that reached their peaks in 2002-2003), and the \"Defensive Shield\" operation62 convinced relevant sectors of Italian public opinion of the existence of such a link.</s><s>In order to understand how an Islamophobic milieu came into existence, different phases and actors have to be identified.</s><s>According to Stefano Allievi, professor of Sociology at Padua University, the year 2000 has to be considered the turning point in terms of construction of a progressively pervasive Islamophobia,63 due to three main events.</s><s>First of all, in September 2000, Bologna Cardinal Giacomo Biffi wrote a document related to Islamic migration to Italy defining it as \"problematic\".</s><s>He clearly stated that if Europe was not able to discover its Christian roots, it would become a Muslim region.64</s><s>Secondly, in 2000 Lega Nord, part of Berlusconi\\'s coalition government and particularly interested in opposing foreign migration, started its campaign against the construction of a new mosque in Lodi.65 Finally, Giovanni Sartori, one of the leading political commentators, anticipated in an editorial66 published in the newspaper Il Corriere della Sera, the content of his book Pluralism, Multiculturalism and Foreigners that was to have been published the following year.</s><s>Sartori challenged multiculturalism by stating that the Islamic migration was highly problematic in terms of integration and therefore Muslim immigrants represented a serious menace to western societies\\' stability.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b62\">67</ref> The following year, this idea was strengthened and an Islamophobic discourse became openly acknowledged after the events of September 11.</s><s>In particular, on 29 September the well-known journalist Oriana Fallaci published in Il Corriere della Sera her provocative article \"Anger and Pride\".</s><s>This editorial had a huge impact on Italian public opinion.</s><s>A few months later, it was published as a book, which sold 500,000 copies abroad and 1,500,000 in Italy, reaching 28 editions.68</s><s>That article was extremely relevant, because it constructed the theoretical link between the menace represented by Muslim migrants in Europe and the terrorism threat.</s><s>According to Fallaci, both the United States and Europe-and therefore Italy-were under the same type of attack by Muslim groups.</s><s>In this sense, Fallaci prepared the road for Bat Ye\\'or\\'s book, Eurabia, which was published in Italian in 2007.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b65\">69</ref> However, most important, Fallaci paved the way for another link, the connection between the Islamic menace against \"the West\" and the need to support Israel.</s><s>On 12 April 2002, she published an article entitled \"I, Oriana Fallaci, find it disgusting. . .</s><s>.\",70 in which she attacked the left-wing political parties and civil society organizations that were demonstrating all over Europe against Israel and specifically against the \"Defensive Shield\" operation.</s><s>According to her, it was immoral to demonstrate against Israel, which was defending itself from Palestinian terrorism, as \"the West\" was doing against Islamist organizations, such as Al Qaeda.</s></p><p><s>In the same year, another Italian journalist, Fiamma Nirenstein-who later became Parliamentarian as a member of Berlusconi\\'s party-strengthened the link between the Islamic terrorist menace and the defense of Israel.</s><s>In that year, she published a book, The Defection.</s><s>How the West Betrayed the Jews,71 which sold 200,000 copies during the first months of publication.</s><s>The main thesis of the book-later confirmed in another book, We are Israel72-was that Palestinian terrorism, which was part of the wider Islamist terror network, not only menaced the existence of Israel, but was also directed against all of Western civilization, whose bulwark was represented by Israel.</s></p><p><s>In April 2002 the link proposed by Fallaci, and expressed more explicitly by Nirenstein, was shared by numerous and relevant sectors of Italian society, when the so-called Israel Day was organized.</s><s>On 15 April the newspaper Il Foglio73 decided to hold a rally in support of Israel.</s><s>This event-that followed the previously organized USA Day, held on 10 November 2001was attended by around 15,000 individuals.</s><s>Among them, there were people from the Jewish communities and civil society, private individuals, several members of the government, and representatives of the entire spectrum of the Italian political parties, apart from the so-called \"radical left\".</s></p><p><s>However, the most striking aspect-more than the actual participation, which was not so impressive-was that the plea in Il Foglio to support the initiative was signed by large numbers of individuals from a wide spectrum of political and cultural sectors.74</s><s>The main reason for the success of the initiative was that it was perceived as an \"either-or\" choice: supporting either \"the West\" with its democratic, liberal values, or \"Islamic terrorism\"; being either with Israel or with terrorism.</s><s>It was a demonstration that both public opinion and the government (for example FM Frattini\\'s position during Netanyahu\\'s visit to Italy in December 2002) were adopting an ideological framework according to which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was part of the wider war on terror that \"the West\" was conducting.</s></p><p><s>A third important actor whose articles and books greatly contributed to the reinforcement of this Islamophobic pro-Israeli milieu is the Egyptian-Italian journalist Magdi Once such an Islamophobic, pro-Israeli milieu was created and shared by the government and numerous sectors of public opinion, press and TV contributed in circulating an Islamophobic, pro-Israeli discourse.</s><s>In particular, a relevant role was played by four newspapers, all of which are strictly connected to the government.</s><s>Three of them-Il Foglio, Libero, and Il Giornale-are under PM Berlusconi\\'s direct control because either he or one of his relatives owns them, and because the newspaper\\'s editorial line is fully dictated by Berlusconi himself.</s><s>The fourth newspaper, La Padania, belongs to Lega Nord, which was the first to use a clear Islamophobic discourse against the Muslim immigrants.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, this type of press has confirmed and strengthened the government\\'s positions by hosting articles written by journalists and intellectuals that belonged to the depicted milieu.</s><s>On the other hand, the press has acted as a sort of \"public address system\" in disseminating the government\\'s positions to public opinion.</s><s>For example, an analysis of these newspapers in December 2008-January 2009 clearly demonstrates how much an Islamophobic pro-Israeli discourse has been used to report the war between Israel and Hamas.77</s><s>Journalists such as Nirenstein78 and politicians such as Antonio Martino,79 Minister of Defense in the second and third Berlusconi governments, have clearly embraced such a discourse, confirming the strict link between

episodes that took place in 200980-confirm the decision of the Italian government to fully support Israel and its policies.81</s><s>This proves that Berlusconi\\'s stance in favor of Israel did not rely exclusively on foreign policy reasons, i.e., the closeness to the George W. Bush presidency.</s><s>In fact, despite the change in U.S. foreign policy after Obama\\'s arrival at the White House, Italy has maintained its position.</s><s>Domestic politics also played a crucial role in shaping Italian foreign policy towards Israel.</s><s>Specifically, as this article tried to demonstrate, two elements played a relevant role in the reversal of Italian foreign policy: the pro-Israeli stance by newly born political parties, specifically AN, and the birth of an Islamophobic pro-Israeli milieu that is gradually receiving more and more consent.</s></p></div><figure xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\" xml:id=\"fig_0\"><head>Notes 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>The first visit took place in 2000, when Berlusconi was leading the opposition to the Romano Prodi\\'s left-wing coalition government.</s><s>The second was when Berlusconi was PM, in June 2003, shortly before Italy took up the presidency of the EU.</s><s>See Maria Grazia Enardu, \"Berlusconi in Israel between Scilla and Cariddi.\"</s><s>Accessed 2 July 2010, http://www.affarinternazionali.it/articolo.asp?ID= 1386.</s><s>2.

compared with other liberal democratic states, been a more prominent function of the criminal justice system <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">(Bergalli 1997;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b11\">Brandariz García and Faraldo Cabana 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Key reforms in criminal law and the criminal justice system, particularly since 2011, have been introduced to deal with the rise of social protest.</s><s>Amendments to the Criminal Code and a Law of Citizen Security (known widely as the Gag Law) introduced new restrictions on the right to protest and political expression in the wake of the financial crisis and the social unrest that ensued <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b23\">(Oliver et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Like other European nations, Spain has used anti-terrorism laws widely to deal with domestic political protests <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">(Bergalli 1997;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b10\">Brandariz 2007;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b18\">Jiménez Franco 2019)</ref>.</s><s>In the struggle over the right to self-determination in Catalonia, we have witnessed a deliberate show of police strength aimed at preventing both the use of the ballot box and the campaign of civil disobedience in the streets.</s><s>In the run-up to the 2017 Catalan referendum, websites were closed down, ballot papers were seized by the million and post was intercepted and confiscated.</s><s>The extremity of Spain\\'s response to the referendum was remarkable.</s><s>Human Rights Watch\\'s assessment of the events of 1 October 2017 concluded that Spanish police engaged in excessive force when \"using batons to hit non-threatening protesters and causing multiple injuries\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Human Rights Watch 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The level of criminalization of political opposition and political protest connected to those events is unprecedented in contemporary Europe.</s><s>A total of 712 town mayors were charged with \"assisting the referendum,\" and many were detained for questioning by the police.</s><s>The sentences imposed against the nine high-profile political prisoners on 14 October 2019 have fuelled the conflict.</s><s>The police violence that followed created a conveyor belt of more political prisoners, many of whom are likely to go to jail for a decade for their participation in public demonstrations.</s></p><p><s>Amnesty International has condemned the trial of the political prisoners, arguing that it \"contravenes the principle of legality and permits the imposition of disproportionate restrictions on conduct\" (Amnesty International 2019).</s><s>The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had previously demanded the release of political prisoners <ref type=\"bibr\">(Reuters, May 19 2019)</ref>.</s><s>In other words, two of the largest human rights NGOs, along with a key UN body, have explicitly accused Spain of committing state crimes in its repression of the Catalan self-determination movement.</s><s>This condemnation has been replicated in a ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the Spanish Supreme Court had no right to judge or to condemn Oriol Junqueras, the vice-president of the Catalan Government during the referendum, due to his subsequent election to the European Parliament.</s><s>The Court therefore declared the verdict of 14 October against him null and void and ordered the Spanish Court to release him.</s><s>At the time of writing, the Spanish Supreme Court has refused to do so.</s></p><p><s>This paper asks how we can explain this remarkable punitive turn against the political opponents of a liberal democratic state in twenty-first-century Europe.</s><s>It uses Michel Foucault\\'s analysis as a point of departure for understanding how the form of state power witnessed in Catalonia is entirely consistent with a Westphalian fixation with the indissoluble unity of statehood.</s><s>The paper then discusses the recent historical context for the state violence that we have witnessed in recent years in Catalonia, highlighting a continuity in political, economic and cultural power that we describe as postfascism.</s><s>Spain\\'s postfascism is materially and ideologically driven by politics.</s><s>We depart from the usual critique of politicized State Crime 9.1 2020 justice, pointing to how deeper historical forces shape the institutional structures of power.</s><s>We conclude with a discussion of the particular form of state that is being defended in Spain, and the consequences of this for understanding what is unfolding in Catalonia.</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>Spain must be defended</head><p><s>The events described above have been widely explained in the global media and in more critical commentaries as a result of the rise of Catalan nationalism.</s><s>This paper develops a different perspective.</s><s>It argues that the events of the past few years must also be understood in the context of Spanish nationalism.</s><s>As this section will argue, there can be no doubt that the events of 1 October 2017 and the subsequent repression represented a serious internal threat to Spanish unity.</s><s>They also represented a threat to the status quo that would be a severe blow to the integrity of the Spanish state.</s><s>As this paper unfolds we will begin to see how the conflict in Catalonia is primarily shaped by the Spanish nationalist question <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b33\">(Taibo 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In order to frame our approach, we begin this section by briefly discussing some of the key passages in Michel Foucault\\'s now classic text Society Must Be Defended.</s></p><p><s>In this text Michel Foucault famously inverted the Clausewitz aphorism to assert that politics is the continuation of war by other means.</s><s>He gives three reasons for drawing this conclusion.</s><s>First, the power relations that we find in liberal states are essentially anchored in a pattern of force that was established in and through war.</s><s>This is the history of the Westphalian state system, in which the modern state was born from an ability to dominate a territory or a people through violence.</s><s>Second, what appears as \"civil peace\" is really a process by which political struggles and clashes over power continue this relationship of war/force through state institutions.</s><s>Third, only violence and force -war -can be the final arbiter in political struggles.</s><s>In setting up this framework, Foucault builds upon a long history of sociological work that has noted that the Western states were founded on principles of violence and/or war, and that this legacy shapes power relations in the modern state (e.g.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">Weber 1919</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Weber /1965;;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Benjamin 1921</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">Benjamin /1978;;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">Tilly 1985)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We return to discussing those three points as a framework for understanding the conflict in Catalonia in the conclusion to this paper.</s><s>For the moment it is important to note that Foucault\\'s formulation becomes useful for the task of understanding this conflict, if we view the current political regime in Spain as \"postfascist\" <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">(Bernat and Whyte 2020)</ref>.</s><s>That is, that whilst the Spanish state cannot be described either as Fascist or Francoist, it does at the same time retain the same rationales, the same bureaucratic structures and the same basic pattern of authoritarianism that existed under Franco.</s></p><p><s>Produced and distributed by Pluto Journals www.plutojournals.com/scj/</s><s>Following Foucault, we argue that the current Spanish regime of power has its roots in the Franco dictatorship, which, in a very direct sense, illuminates the idea that politics is the continuation of war by other means.</s><s>The Spanish regime of power in the Franco period was strongly concentrated in the military <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">(Payne 1986</ref>).</s><s>It is difficult to see how the regime of power could be configured any other way.</s><s>After all, Franco\\'s state was born after a coup d\\'état perpetrated by the army and a civil war that lasted three years.</s><s>We would argue that the Second Spanish Republic government that Franco defeated in the civil war was also shaped by the historical foundations of violence and/or war.</s><s>Not only did the government of the Second Republic resort to violence to preserve state power, but it could not survive without doing so (see e.g.</s><s>essays by Frances Lannon and Adrian Shubert in <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b26\">Preston, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>This is not to say that the violence that underpins different state formations is of a unified character.</s><s>Whereas the Second Republic sought to diminish Spain\\'s perpetuation of colonial wars, Franco\\'s coup d\\'état was orchestrated by a colonial army (with the help of banks and a fascist party).</s><s>It was a colonial army that had suffered major military defeats over the previous 50 years, including the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.</s><s>In the years preceding the civil war it had been defeated in Morocco several times, most notably at the Battle of Annual in July 1921.</s><s>The Spanish civil war was understood by the nationalist cause as a crusade to restore the integrity of Spain.</s><s>In this sense, we can say that the civil war was part of the response by a humiliated army to reassert control over the domestic population and a government that challenged property relations and the class system, and provided too many rights to workers, women and peripheral nations <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b2\">(Balfour 2002)</ref>.</s><s>It is also important to keep in mind the role played by the Catholic Church in providing ideological support to the coup d\\'état, particularly since it cemented the subsequent dictatorship through what was called \"National Catholicism\" which remained as a main ideological foundation of the dictatorship until Franco\\'s death <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b27\">(Preston 2011;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b12\">Carr 1982)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The subsequent regime remained tightly controlled by the army <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b24\">(Payne 1986)</ref>, which was able to exert considerable political power through the figure of Franco, a general of the Spanish Army who promoted himself to Generalisimo <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">(Balfour 2001)</ref>.</s><s>The Vice-President was a Navy admiral.</s><s>Academic power was highly controlled by the Army; many professors appointed to the universities came from an Army background.</s><s>In the criminal justice system, the martial courts were influential in perpetuating the most brutal and unrestrained repression <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b28\">(Richards 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Perhaps most importantly, the Army played a key role in the economic system of power; its most senior officers were appointed to many of the key positions in the state-led corporations <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b1\">(Balfour 2001;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">Maestre 2019)</ref>.</s><s>According to Franco\\'s grandson, the last words that the dictator said to the Spanish King were: \"Highness, the only thing I ask you is to defend Spanish unity.\"</s></p></div>\\n<div xmlns=\"http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\"><head>State Crime 9.1 2020</head><p><s>Following the demise of the Franco regime, the Spanish transition to democracy failed to bring accountability to the regime and the members of the Army.</s><s>As part of the settlement, the Army was supposed to have a minor role in the political, cultural and economic life of the new regime <ref type=\"bibr\">(Navarro 2006;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b14\">Fontana 2014</ref>).</s><s>However, many retained the key positions that the Army had previously secured for them.</s><s>As <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b21\">Maestre (2019)</ref> has argued, the result was that the regime of power was not so concentrated in the hands of the Army as an institution, but its influence was effectively exerted through the continuity of this elite with their leading roles in other social and economic institutions.</s><s>We mean this in both the sense that ruling elites have close interconnected ties that are consolidated through their political, economic and social origins <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">(Miliband 1969)</ref> and in the sense that the form of relations across elites is a function of the form that the state adopts <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b25\">(Poulantzas 1969)</ref>.</s><s>As Poulantzas argues:</s></p><p><s>[e]ach particular form of capitalist state is thus characterized by a particular form of relations among its branches, and by the predominance of one or of certain of its branches over the others: liberal state, interventionist state, Bonapartism, military dictatorship or fascism.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Poulantzas 1969: 75)</ref> From our perspective, the continuity of Franco\\'s state apparatuses and the preservation of so many of the constitutional arrangements and cultural practices shape both state and civil society in contemporary Spain.</s><s>This is a crucial aspect of the continuity of the postfascist system.</s><s>But the continuity that we find in the bureaucratic and cultural practices of the state do not of themselves say anything definitive about the form of the capitalist state in Spain.</s><s>Rather, they provide a basis for the continuity of the ruling class.</s><s>Nor can the social connections across elites alone account for the cohesiveness and longevity of ruling class power.</s><s>Rather those ruling elites are bound together by a nationalist internal unityperhaps more than in any other European state (though some, such as the UK or France, are close rivals) that provide a unifying logic and thus provide a means of binding together the form that capitalism takes in Spain.</s><s>The unitary idea that the defence of Spain is paramount exists as the dominant logic which binds ruling elites together.</s><s>Without their capacity to organize a common hegemonic project around this dominant logic, it is doubtful whether those elites could retain their pre-eminent position.</s></p><p><s>As this paper will argue, it is a dominant internal logic that, in order to remain credible, must keep the Francoist elements of today\\'s ruling class in Spain hidden.</s><s>At the same time, Franco and Francoism cannot be entirely disrespected in \"official\" Spain.</s><s>The settlement underpinning the 1978 regime ensured that the new Spanish state did not officially recognize the dictator\\'s treatment of political  <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b22\">2006;</ref><ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b16\">Hernández de Miguel 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Hugely symbolic though this wilful institutional blindness was, this does not constitute the specific internal unity that enables elites to express their right to rule.</s><s>That specific internal unity we characterize as the all-embracing claim that the apparatuses of the state must be organized around the project to \"defend Spain\".</s><s>The idea that the unity of Spain must be defended, for us, sums up the internal logic or unity that binds Spain\\'s ruling elites together as a hegemonic force.</s><s>This idea gives meaning to the defence of Spanish capitalism.</s><s>Of course, it is not the only logic; Spain follows other capitalist liberal democracies in using the tropes

Prestige oil tanker and the terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004.</s></p><p><s>This renewed patriotism represented a cynical and calculated bid to shift the role of the state from being a welfare and

Catalan claims for more political autonomy have become part of this strategy.</s><s>Bizarre as it may sound outside Spain, a boycott of Catalan products, including Cava, was encouraged by Produced and

Catalan referendum.</s><s>The only major political party to oppose the new Statute of Autonomy, the PP initiated the challenge to the legality of the Statute in the Constitutional Court.</s><s>After four years, the Constitutional Court declared in 2010 that key parts of the proposed document were unconstitutional, interpreted Catalonia\\'s political autonomy in highly restrictive terms and rewrote or blocked key proposals on the status of the Catalan language, the legal system and fiscal policy.</s></p><p><s>There is some history that is worth noting here.</s><s>The first Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia was introduced in 1932 during the Second Spanish Republic <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b35\">(Vilar 1984)</ref>.</s><s>It was subsequently abolished by Franco in a move largely

approved in a public referendum.</s><s>So, when the Constitutional Court denied the legality of the third Statute of Autonomy, and rewrote much of what had been agreed, most of Catalonia could see the hand of history resting on its shoulder.</s><s>This was not history repeating what Franco had done, but as a political response to the PP, the Court\\'s decision was widely perceived as Francoist.</s></p><p><s>The Constitutional Court has continued to deploy its powers routinely against the autonomous parliaments.</s><s>Indeed, since 2006 more than 40 laws passed by the Catalan

July 2015 law which banned the eviction of people before they were offered social housing, also including a measure to protect the vulnerable against having their water and electricity cut off.</s><s>This law had cross-party support in the Catalan Parliament, but the Spanish Constitutional Court overturned it, effectively making thousands homeless in its own crude bid to narrow the Catalans\\' freedom of action.</s><s>More recently, the Spanish Constitutional Court has ruled that the Catalan Parliament has no right to debate the issue of self-determination, the monarchy or even the court verdict that condemned the political prisoners.</s></p><p><s>In those pronouncements by the Spanish legal and political institutions, obedience is sought, above all else, to the principle of Spanish unity.</s><s>It is this principle that drives the deep structural politics behind the strategy of repression.</s><s>As Foucault argued, what appears as \"civil peace\" is really a process by

repressive function of the courts in recent events.</s><s>In particular, we can observe very clear continuities in the way that political control is exerted over the national courts.</s><s>The Audiencia Nacional was the court responsible for initiating the prosecution of the nine Catalan political prisoners before their cases are passed to the Supreme Court for trial.</s><s>This court was created in the image of Franco\\'s notorious Public Order Tribunal, maintaining the judges, prosecutors and legislation.</s><s>The court explicitly deals with issues of conflict deemed to be \"political\".</s><s>The Audiencia Nacional has been condemned internationally for imprisoning Basque political leaders and for a string of highly controversial political convictions.</s></p><p><s>The sentencing of the political prisoners needs to be understood in precisely this context.</s><s>The court system is organized around political modes of appointment and decision-making.</s><s>Yet the purpose of the court and the legal system generally is the opposite.</s><s>As we have noted above, the process of individualizing responsibility and blame enabled the state to mask the political and social content of conflicts.</s><s>In political conflicts, the overarching function of law, and especially criminal law, is to mask the political content of those political conflicts.</s></p><p><s>Thus, one of the most frequent assertions that has been made by government sources about the political prisoners is that they are \"common criminals\".</s><s>They are not, therefore, political prisoners.</s><s>By masking the political content, the state does not need to explain why it is locking up its opponents for protesting or organizing against it.</s><s>It merely asserts that what they did was unlawful and therefore criminal.</s><s>In this way, collective political subjects and demands are turned into individuals that broke the law <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b29\">(Rodríguez 2003)</ref>.</s><s>If this is a rationale that we find at the heart of all legal systems, it is one that is turbo-charged in the context of the Catalan conflict.</s><s>The grossly disproportionate sentences are testimony to this, and so is the nature of the offences that they were charged with.</s><s>The nine political and civil society leaders sentenced on 14 October 2019 were charged with sedition.</s><s>This is an offence that was invented in the sixteenthcentury courts of Europe to assuage the paranoia of the not-yet-fully-formed democratic state.</s><s>In Britain, as in most European countries, the offence of sedition no longer exists.</s><s>Yet in Spain, the paranoid logic of sedition is drawing a growing number of political dissenters and protestors into the criminal justice system.</s><s>The crime of sedition, used to condemn the \"big\" political prisoners to long custodial sentences in October 2019 assumes the rupture of the public order.</s><s>This is understood as a disruption of the normal functioning of the public institutions.</s><s>That is, the crime of sedition is not a breach of the peace or a crime that disrupts everyday life, but very specifically criminalizes a challenge to state institutions and their regular functioning.</s></p><p><s>A similar logic pervades the rise in numbers of people accused of \"hate crimes\" and \"discrimination\" against the state.</s><s>In one case in 2018, a local mayor was accused of \"discrimination against the Spanish nation and the corps of the Guardia Civil\" for making public statements against state violence. 4</s><s>Bizarre as it might seem, his experience is not unique.</s><s>Numerous ordinary people who have dared to condemn police violence -or even talk about it in public -have been hauled in front of the judiciary, facing prison for \"hate crimes\" against the Spanish state.</s><s>Some witnesses have been charged with such \"hate crimes\" for posting Facebook statements and teachers have been charged with the same offence for daring to discuss the violence of the Spanish National Police and the Guardia Civil in school classrooms <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">(Bernat and Whyte 2020)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>When stripped of political content, deeply political disputes and political conflicts can be devoured by the state and regurgitated as conflicts necessitating a purely legal or repressive response (if there is no political content, then the state has a compelling right to respond with force rather than politics).</s><s>This process, one in which political disputes are resolved by the naked practice of war/force, is a very pure example of what Foucault means when he concludes that only war/ force can be the final arbiter in the political struggles that occur in the modern liberal state.</s></p><p><s>Yet in his analysis in Society Must Be Defended, Foucault does not see this as an explicit process of depoliticization.</s><s>In the sense that politics is war/force by another means, Foucault does not see war/force as a set of practices and logics that displace or eradicate politics.</s><s>Yet the eradication of the political content of struggles does seem to be apparent in the strategy of the Spanish state; the Spanish state is seeking to displace or eradicate politics.</s><s>This much is obvious is the consistent repetition of the judges and prosecutors in the trial of the nine political prisoners sentenced in October 2019 that they must be described as \"common criminals\" (thus they are not worthy of political recognition).</s><s>Recognizing the criminalization process as one that seeks depoliticization brings us closer to a Gramscian analysis.</s><s>We say this in the sense that the narrative of the political prisoner seeks to bolster a popular (Spanish) consent for the criminalization of political prisoners.</s><s>In the absence of meaningful consent for the project of Spanish unity across the Catalan population, the state relies on the techniques and apparatuses of repression.</s><s>The penal system is the most frequently used instrument of social control <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b6\">(Bergalli 1997)</ref>.</s><s>And the construction of the state as the victim of \"hate crimes\" or any other crimes for that matter is part of this <ref type=\"bibr\"

for its rule.</s><s>This clear challenge to the hegemony of the state reflects the fundamental vulnerability of the project of Spanish unity.</s><s>As it becomes more vulnerable to accusations of political repression by its opponents, the state resorts to modes of punishment that depoliticize; modes that mask any political content that might reveal the real problem for the state: that the unity of Spain is under threat.</s><s>The response to this has been simply to criminalize disobedience to authority.</s><s>This is essentially what criminal accusations against those that criticize state violence are: crimes of disobedience to authority.</s><s>The Catalan political prisoners can therefore never be \"political\" prisoners in the eyes of the state: they are either terrorists or common criminals, and both labels have been used by the Spanish state to label all of those arrested and convicted of offences relating to civil disobedience and peaceful political protest.</s><s>And this is essentially what the crime of sedition is.</s><s>Sedition in Spanish law means preventing \"the application of the Law or any authority . . .</s><s>from legitimately carrying out their functions\" using means that are outside the law <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b13\">(Fernàndez 2020)</ref>.</s><s>Sedition is the offence that outlaws civil disobedience and requires subservience to authority.</s><s>It requires no other test other than some level of unlawful disobedience and therefore requires minimal political justification.</s><s>The Catalan crisis can therefore be read as a moment that has its roots in the way that social grievances have been dealt with through a prism of war/force.</s><s>The Spanish Constitutional Court has been used to reinforce the central power of the Spanish state -and ultimately resort to militarized force -to quell the social demands of the Catalan political institutions.</s><s>In doing so, it has depoliticized those claims through the resort to war/force.</s></p><p><s>In the Catalan conflict, the law has effectively sought to replace the social and political content of the dispute.</s><s>The reduction of the current conflict to a \"national\" or even \"terrorist\" conflict obscures the long political crisis faced by the Spanish state, and in particular the state revanchism in the period following the 2008 financial crisis.</s><s>This is a general point we can make about all legal systems.</s><s>The overarching function of law, and especially criminal law, is to mask the social content</s></p></div>\\n<div

state <ref type=\"bibr\">(Billig 1995: 47)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In a key passage that comes towards the end of Society Must Be Defended, Foucault uses the death of Franco as a rhetorical device to show how power is not only concerned with governing life, but is equally concerned with governing political continuities.</s><s>Here, Foucault illuminates a political process by which Franco\\'s legacy itself was kept alive as a means of exercising power.</s></p><p><s>And so the man who had exercised the absolute power of life and death over hundreds of thousands of people fell under the influence of a power that managed life so well, that took so little heed of death, and he didn\\'t even realize that he was dead and was being kept alive after his death.</s><s><ref type=\"bibr\">(Foucault 2003: 248-9)</ref> As we have shown, one consequence of Franco\\'s life after death is that the form of justice resorted to by the Spanish state is one that seeks to replace politics with law; to impose a kind of legalized violence that is at the same time a proxy for war and a proxy for politics.</s><s>What appears as a process of depoliticization cannot entirely rid the system of political disputes.</s><s>After all, if the Spanish state is attempting to depoliticize the bid for self-determination in Catalonia through all the techniques described in this paper, this does not mean that the state can make this political conflict disappear.</s><s>It only makes politics more war-like.</s><s>And by making politics more war-like, it seeks to further mask the content of political struggles.</s></p><p><s>As we have noted in the earlier sections of this paper, in Society Must Be Defended, Foucault identifies three enduring features of the war-like nature of political power.</s><s>First, political power in liberal states is anchored in a pattern of force that was established in and through war.</s><s>This is a point that has been reinforced in different ways by a range of authors, most famously, Charles <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b34\">Tilly (1985)</ref>.</s><s>Spain\\'s postfascist regime is essentially anchored in a pattern of force that was established in and through its colonial wars, and latterly through the civil war.</s><s>The referendum and its aftermath have brought to the surface some shocking examples of residual Francoism and fascism in the police and the military.</s><s>There have been numerous cases of police officers displaying Francoist symbols, and even giving the fascist salute in public.</s><s>In one case, a Spanish National Police officer was photographed brutally beating a well-known pro-independence journalist while shouting \"Viva España y Viva Franco.\" 5  Second, what appears as \"civil peace\" is really a process by which political struggles continue the relationship of war/force through state institutions, a point that echoes Max Weber\\'s famous essay, written in 1919, Politics as a Vocation.</s><s>The application of article 155, the police brutality on 1 October and the imprisonment of politicians and activists committed with self-determination are the logical outcome for a process that aims to challenge the national settlement, and therefore the social settlement.</s><s>The legal and judicial systems are part of this wider institutional arrangement, but the part in charge of securing its continuity.</s></p><p><s>Third, the Spanish state, by ramping up the violence in the courts and on the streets, and appearing to recognize no limits on its own application of force, is testimony to Foucault\\'s warning that only violence and force can be the final arbiter in political struggles.</s><s>This is a point that has similar origins in Walter Benjamin\\'s thesis on the relationship between law and violence.</s><s>For Benjamin, the type of police violence witnessed in Catalonia and the application of extreme laws to defend the integrity of the state result from a position in which the state \"can no longer guarantee through the legal system the empirical ends that it desires at any price to attain\" <ref type=\"bibr\">(Benjamin 1921</ref><ref type=\"bibr\">(Benjamin /1978: 287): 287)</ref>.</s><s>Violence, in Benjamin\\'s terms, is necessary to uphold law, to preserve the rule of law and also to expand the state\\'s law-making capacity.</s></p><p><s>Spanish nationalism appears as the ideological form taken by the current social order.</s><s>Thus, criminalization works by blocking social groups and demands from a legal point of view, emptying their political content.</s><s>This is precisely what Foucault means when he says that society must be defended: a society that presents itself without social content, and without political justification.</s><s>Yet, in the process of presenting itself without social content, and without political justification, the state is not actually eradicating politics; it is merely masking and repackaging political struggles as something else.</s><s>This repackaging of politics, to follow Foucault, is sought in a form that reflects the war-making origins of the state.</s><s>We argue, therefore, that in the Catalan case, as in countless other political conflicts, the autonomy of the political realm is a fallacy: the political realm cannot hide its violent origins.</s><s>This is not to say, however that there are not important distinctions between different political formations.</s><s>We cannot ignore the specific content and the purpose of the war-making origins of the state and how this is reshaped by social forces.</s><s>State-making and war-making has always sought to preserve or to challenge the dominance of particular social groups.</s><s>State-making and war-making has always sought to defend a particular social order.</s><s>And this, in many ways, is the missing link in Foucault\\'s analysis.</s><s>The idea that society must be defended on its own terms is powerful.</s><s>But what is at stake in this power game is the type of society that must be defended.</s><s>We cannot underestimate the importance of class continuity within the Spanish state.</s><s>We have described this in more detail elsewhere <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b8\">(Bernat and Whyte 2020)</ref>, but the ruling elite in Spain displays a remarkable degree of longevity across the economic and political worlds.</s></p><p><s>Franco\\'s ruling elite has retained its position in finance and business, and in legal and cultural spheres.</s><s>This is not to say that those ruling elites have been reconstituted in many domains, but it is to say that the core of power has been largely undisturbed.</s></p><p><s>The project of Spanish nationalism has consequences that should not merely be measured in terms of explicit forms of state repression.</s><s>This is a form of Spanish unity that reproduces a strong social inequality.</s><s>As Navarro points out ( <ref type=\"formula\">2006</ref>) the causes of this unfair social system can be found in an institutional structure of power, centred in the power of monarchy, that consolidates conservative social forces in Spain.</s><s>The project of Spanish unity and the legacy of the post-Franco settlement helps explain why Spain has one of the less developed welfare states of the EU-15.</s><s>It helps explain the origins of the gross inequalities in the health and education system <ref type=\"bibr\">(Navarro 2006)</ref>.</s><s>It also helps explain why the institutional structure has been able to defend a regressive fiscal policy that underfunds social spending.</s><s>And as we have already seen, this institutional structure relies particularly on the judicial system as a keystone of this conservative dimension.</s><s>For example, in a key case in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the banks against more than a million citizens, who were estimated to have been forced to pay an average of more than €40,000 per mortgage <ref type=\"bibr\" target=\"#b20\">(León 2019)</ref>.</s><s>Two years later, in 2019, the same court ruled against the possibility of municipalizing public services in a
