The requirements of academic philology , readability , staging , and performance all call for complex strategies in adaptation and creation .

The postwar translations of the 1950 s and 1960 s had to meet the demands of the market and the media .

Moreover , since the end of the Italian colonial empire coincided with a lost world war and a general upheaval of",postfascism,", no attention nor energy were devoted to keeping up an Italian cultural presence in former colonies .

"…The Turning Point of the Berlusconi Government ABSTR ACT After having presented a brief overview of the relationship between Italy and Israel since its founding to the 1990 s , this article analyses the reasons why the Berlusconi government decided to change the Italian foreign policy towards Israel , moving from a more pro-Palestinian stance to a clearly pro-Israel one . The international situation after 9/11 and the new state of affairs of Italian politics following the birth of the so-called Second Republic might explain such a turning-point . In particular , the",post-fascist,"Alleanza Nazionale ( AN ) party was looking for legitimization by the Italian Jewish communities in order to present itself as a modern European right-wing party . Thus , AN decided to openly support Israel , thus pushing the entire government towards this position . At the same time , the birth of an Islamophobic milieu made relevant sectors of the civil society back Israel , as part of the wider battle that "" the West "" is conducting against "" the Muslim fundamentalism "" .

" In particular , there are two aspects that have to be taken into consideration .53 The first has to do with Italian foreign policy : the closeness to the United States that characterized Berlusconi 's policy almost automatically turned into a full pro-Israeli stance . The second and more relevant aspect is related to Italian domestic policy , and specifically to two phenomena : the birth of pro-Israeli political parties after the end of the so-called First Republic , mainly Alleanza Nazionale ( AN ) , i.e. , the heir of Movimento Sociale Italiano ( MSI ) , a",post-Fascist,"party ; and the creation of an ideological and cultural milieu , which is characterized by being Islamophobic and progressively more and more pro-Israeli . Traditionally , according to the so-called theory of the "" three circles "" ,54 Italian foreign policy has been the result of a balance between the "" first circle "" , i.e. , the relationship with Washington , the "" second circle "" , i.e. , the presence in the European institutions ( previously the European Community , and later the EU ) , and the "" third circle "" , i.e. , the orientation…",,,,,,

In order to understand the reasons why the Italian foreign policy towards Israel changed so radically , it is also important to take into consideration two phenomena that have taken place in the Italian context . The first occurrence has to do with the legitimacy that Gianfranco Fini was seeking for his newly created political party , Alleanza Nazionale ( AN ) , born out of the former",post-Fascist,"party .59 In order to demonstrate that AN no longer had anything to do with Fascism , Fini was looking for a sort of "" whitewash "" that could affirm the new status of AN as a modern European-style right-wing party . No one could provide him with such a "" patent "" better than the Italian Jewish community .
